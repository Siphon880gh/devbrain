Make sure billing is enabled for the project that contains the enabled API

Visit Google Cloud Platform → Billing → My Projects

[https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/projects](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/projects)

In this example, I have Google Sheet API among other API’s (neither are shown) under Utilities project and that has a billing account.

Here billing is not enabled (not good):

And this is not good either:

If Google says that your account has reached the limit of projects that can have billing, you can fill a form to increase the quota or create a project and enable Google Sheet API and have the google sheet on another google account.
