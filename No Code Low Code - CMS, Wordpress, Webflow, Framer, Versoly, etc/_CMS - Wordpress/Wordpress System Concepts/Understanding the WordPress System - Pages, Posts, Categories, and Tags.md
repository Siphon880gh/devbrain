WordPress offers a flexible content management system, but to get the most out of it, it's important to understand how its core elements work together: **Pages**, **Posts**, **Categories**, and **Tags**.

### Pages

Use **Pages** for evergreen or navigational content. These are typically static and don’t change frequently. Examples include:

- Home page
    
- About Us
    
- Contact
    
- Privacy Policy
    
- Terms of Service
    

Pages are **not organized by date** and **don’t use categories or tags**. They’re best suited for high-level, timeless content that forms the backbone of your website.

### Posts

Use **Posts** when you need chronology, user engagement, or regular updates. Posts are ideal for:

- Blog articles
    
- News updates
    
- Announcements
    
- Tutorials
    

Posts are organized by **date**, support **comments**, and can be sorted using **categories and tags**. They appear in your site's RSS feed and can help drive regular traffic.

### Categories

Use **Categories** to group related posts into **broad sections**. They act like folders for your content and help visitors navigate your site. For example:

- "Marketing"
    
- "Web Development"
    
- "News"
    
- "Product Updates"
    

Each post **must** belong to at least one category. Categories can be **hierarchical**—you can have parent and child categories.

### Tags

Use **Tags** to make your content easier to search and explore via **specific topics** or keywords. Tags are **non-hierarchical** and provide detail beyond categories. For example, a blog post in the "Marketing" category could include tags like:

- SEO
    
- Email campaigns
    
- Conversion rates
    

Tags give you fine-grained control over content discovery and help users find related posts based on shared themes.
