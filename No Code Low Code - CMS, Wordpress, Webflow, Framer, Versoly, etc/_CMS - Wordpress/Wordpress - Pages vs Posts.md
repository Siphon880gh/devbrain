Posts have extra features like categories and password protection
Either posts or pages can be linked directly and cannot necessarily tell if itâ€™s a post or a page from the URL alone

To create a new post or page, you click "Posts" or "Pages" on the left sidebar. It'll become obvious how to edit, delete, or create a new one.
