For templates (predesigned row of elements), refer to: [[WPBakery Page Builder - Save my own templates]].
For rows (predesigned row or column inside a row), this is the page.

You can also predesign elements that you can add from a collection later. Recall that elements are the individual items inside a row.

Edit the element:

Click the element you want to add.

If you want to delete elements that you had saved before, click the "Manage elements" button from "My Elements" panel:

You can delete with "X". This is another place you can add the element from (when clicking +)
