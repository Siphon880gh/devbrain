The Classic Mode is enhanced with a Nectar shortcodes library. See the button "Nectar Shortcodes":

Nectar shortcodes button that opens a library of elements and layouts, then selecting a nectar shortcode opens a wizard of options to configure, and when finalized, inserts a shortcode. This is accessible in the Classic Editor (aka Code Editor) of the enhanced WP Bakery.

And when configuring the shortcode, things like uploading pics into the designed element is possible before inserting the shortcode

The shortcode library IS NOT exhaustive. There are more shortcodes but they havenâ€™t implemented it into the library ui:
