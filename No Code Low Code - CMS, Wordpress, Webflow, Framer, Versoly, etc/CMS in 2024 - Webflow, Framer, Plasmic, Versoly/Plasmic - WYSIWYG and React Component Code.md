**Plasmic** is a visual, open‑architecture web builder that integrates seamlessly with your existing codebase—whether you’re using React, Next.js, Angular, Vue, or more. It lets you visually design and ship real production websites and apps **without getting locked into a walled ecosystem** ([plasmic.app](https://www.plasmic.app/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Plasmic | Build powerful apps fast— without the limits")). 

What sets Plasmic apart is its powerful WYSIWYG editor that supports **importing and exporting real React components**, enabling designers to work visually while developers maintain full control of the code. This two-way collaboration allows teams to move faster, iterate seamlessly, and deliver production-grade experiences without the usual handoff bottlenecks.

## 📦 Core Features

### 🔧 Visual Page & App Builder

A drag‑and‑drop WYSIWYG editor lets you craft responsive layouts, interaction-rich interfaces, and full web apps—from landing pages to internal tools ([docs.plasmic.app](https://docs.plasmic.app/learn/apps/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Plasmic for building full-stack apps")).

### ♻️ Codebase-Friendly Components

Bring your own React components into Plasmic, register them, and enable non devs to use them visually. You can also export Plasmic-generated components back into your code, creating tight designer-developer collaboration ([github.com](https://github.com/plasmicapp/plasmic?utm_source=chatgpt.com "plasmicapp/plasmic: Visual builder for React. Build apps ... - GitHub")).

### 🔗 Figma & Design System Integration

Import Figma designs, toggle between design/content modes, and tap into bespoke design systems—including Tailwind UI, Ant Design, or Material UI ([forum.plasmic.app](https://forum.plasmic.app/t/how-can-you-bring-tailwind-ui-or-other-design-systems-into-plasmic/715?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How can you bring Tailwind UI or other design systems into Plasmic? - Plasmic Studio Questions ...")).

### ☁️ CMS, Headless, Dynamic Data

Use built-in headless CMS features (versioning, i18n, A/B testing) or connect to external data sources—Shopify, Contentful, Supabase, GraphQL, or custom APIs ([plasmic.app](https://www.plasmic.app/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Plasmic | Build powerful apps fast— without the limits")).

### 🌐 Deployment Freedom

You own the code and hosting stack. Deploy anywhere—on-premises, serverless, Jamstack, or multicloud setups—avoiding vendor lock-in ([plasmic.app](https://www.plasmic.app/site-builder?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The website builder that never limits you - Plasmic")).

### 👥 Collaboration & Team Scale

Supports branching, multiplayer editing, reviews, SSO, fine permissions, SOC‑2 compliance—ideal for enterprise teams ([plasmic.app](https://www.plasmic.app/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Plasmic | Build powerful apps fast— without the limits")).

## 👍 Why Teams Love It

- **Designers & Developers aligned**: "It’s like Figma and Webflow had a baby that outputs React code" ([plasmic.app](https://www.plasmic.app/vs-framer?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Plasmic vs Framer: Compare features & benefits"))
    
- **Production-grade UI builder**: Generate continuous code; not a one-off export ([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/qvvjzk/been_working_for_2_years_on_plasmic_a_visual/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Been working for 2 years on Plasmic, a visual builder for React ..."))
    
- **Enterprise-ready**: SOC‑2, SSO, branching, reviews, i18n—all built-in

## 🚧 Limitations

- **CMS Scheduling**: Advanced scheduling features aren’t as mature as Framer or Webflow ([m.youtube.com](https://m.youtube.com/live/DbV6ZXlVf4U?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Outgrowing Webflow or Framer? Try This No-Code Builder for ...")).
    
- **Design Library Size**: Template variety smaller than Framer’s library .
    
- **No AI Personalization Tools (yet)**: Lacks built-in generative or AI-driven content features like Webflow ([subframe.com](https://www.subframe.com/tips/plasmic-vs-webflow?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Plasmic vs Webflow: Which One is Better in 2025? - Subframe")).
