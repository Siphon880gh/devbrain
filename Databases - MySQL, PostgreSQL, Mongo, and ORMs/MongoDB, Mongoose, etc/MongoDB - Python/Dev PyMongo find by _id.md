find_one by _id be I’ll use ObjectID because it doesn’t search by string for you

In PyMongo, when you need to use `ObjectId` from the `bson` module (which is a part of MongoDB's BSON format), you generally use it to convert string representations of MongoDB ObjectIds into actual ObjectId objects. This is often necessary when querying documents by their `_id` field, as these are stored as ObjectId objects in MongoDB.

To ensure that the `ObjectId` is not undefined and is correctly used, follow these steps:

1. **Import ObjectId Properly**: Ensure you have imported `ObjectId` from the `bson` module.

   ```python
   from bson import ObjectId
   ```

2. **Validate the String Format**: Before converting a string to an `ObjectId`, ensure that the string is a valid ObjectId string. ObjectId strings are 24 characters long and consist of hexadecimal characters.

   You can write a function to check this:

   ```python
   def is_valid_object_id(str_id):
       try:
           ObjectId(str_id)
           return True
       except (TypeError, bson.errors.InvalidId):
           return False
   ```

   Use this function to check if a string is a valid ObjectId:

   ```python
   str_id = "oisadfiso982" # Example string
   if is_valid_object_id(str_id):
       obj_id = ObjectId(str_id)
       # Proceed with using obj_id
   else:
       # Handle invalid ObjectId string
   ```

3. **Handle Exceptions**: When you create an `ObjectId` from a string, it's good practice to handle exceptions that might be raised if the string is not a valid ObjectId.

4. **Check for None or Undefined Values**: If you're fetching the ObjectId string from some source (like a user input or a file), ensure that the value is not `None` or an equivalent undefined value before attempting to convert it.

   ```python
   if str_id is not None and is_valid_object_id(str_id):
       obj_id = ObjectId(str_id)
       # Use obj_id in your queries
   else:
       # Handle the case where str_id is None or invalid
   ```

By following these steps, you can ensure that the use of `ObjectId` in your PyMongo code is robust and handles various edge cases effectively.
