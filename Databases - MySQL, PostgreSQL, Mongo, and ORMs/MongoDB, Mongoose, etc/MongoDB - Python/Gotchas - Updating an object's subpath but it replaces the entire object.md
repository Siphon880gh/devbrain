In mongo python Im updating a key that has an object value. Im adding / overriding key-value pairs inside that object value. How to retain other previous key-value pairs in that object value Iâ€™m not replacing when using $set?

When updating a document in MongoDB, especially when you're dealing with nested objects (or subdocuments), you might want to update certain fields within the subdocument while retaining the others. MongoDB allows you to do this efficiently without overwriting the entire subdocument.  
  
To achieve this, you should use the `$set` operator in your update query. This operator allows you to set the value of a field in a document. If the field does not exist, `$set` will add a new field with the specified value. If you're updating a nested object, you can use dot notation to access the subfields.  
  
Here's a general structure of how you can use it:  
  
```python  
from pymongo import MongoClient  
  
# Connect to MongoDB  
client = MongoClient('[mongodb://localhost:27017/'](mongodb://localhost:27017/'))  
db = client['your_database']  
collection = db['your_collection']  
  
# Document ID or other filter criteria  
filter_criteria = {'_id': your_document_id}  
  
# Update details  
update_data = {  
'$set': {  
'your_nested_field.subfield1': 'new value',  
'your_nested_field.subfield2': 'another new value',  
# Add more fields as needed  
}  
}  
  
# Update the document  
collection.update_one(filter_criteria, update_data)  
```  
  
In this example:  
  
- Replace `your_database` and `your_collection` with your actual database and collection names.  
- `your_document_id` is the identifier for the document you want to update.  
- `your_nested_field` is the key in the document that contains the subdocument (nested object) you want to update.  
- `subfield1` and `subfield2` are the keys within the nested object that you want to add or update. You can specify as many subfields as needed.  
  
This method will only update the specified subfields (`subfield1`, `subfield2`, etc.) in the nested object and will leave other existing fields in that nested object untouched. If the specified subfields do not exist, they will be added to the nested object.
