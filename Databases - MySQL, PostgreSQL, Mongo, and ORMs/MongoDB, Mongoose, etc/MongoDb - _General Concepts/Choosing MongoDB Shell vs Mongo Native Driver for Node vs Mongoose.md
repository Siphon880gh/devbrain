-Differences at a glance:
- MongoDB Shell: Quick and dirty quick configuration through the terminal or bash scripting
- Mongo Native Driver: Flexible data
- Mongoose: Schema restricted data

MongoDB native driver for NodeJS is a wrapper that does not enforce schemas (unlike Mongoose), and has less abstractions, but the drawback is the lack of validation

---

Mongoose Methods vs MongoDB Shell Methods: Mongoose does not explicitly aim to have the same methods as the MongoDB shell. While it provides an abstraction over MongoDB that allows for easier interaction with the database through objects and methods that may be similar to MongoDB's, it's not a direct mirror of the MongoDB shell's API. Mongoose focuses on providing an object data modeling interface that is conducive to working within a Node.js environment, which might lead to differences in how certain operations are performed compared to the MongoDB shell.

**Schema Enforcement in Mongoose**: Yes, Mongoose does enforce schemas. This is a core feature of Mongoose, providing a structure to the documents in a collection, ensuring that they adhere to a predefined schema with specified data types, validation rules, default values, etc.

A more flexible Mongoose:
Although Mongoose is known for its strict schemas, if you need flexibility and don't want to enforce a schema for a particular collection, you can use the Schema.Types.Mixed type for fields that you want to be schema-less, or you can use a completely empty schema. Here's an example of using Schema.Types.Mixed:

```
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const { Schema } = mongoose;

const anySchema = new Schema({ any: {} });
const AnyModel = mongoose.model('Any', anySchema);

// You can store any data in 'any'
const anyData = new AnyModel({ any: { someField: 'anything', otherField: 123 } });
anyData.save();

```


^ In the example above, `any` can be anything you like, as it's defined as an empty object `{}`, which is treated like `Schema.Types.Mixed`. However, it's crucial to note that while this provides flexibility, it also bypasses the benefits of having a schema, such as validation and type checking.

Or the alternate syntax:

```
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const { Schema } = mongoose;

const mixedSchema = new Schema({
  anyField: Schema.Types.Mixed
});

const MixedModel = mongoose.model('Mixed', mixedSchema);

// Now you can store any type of data in `anyField`
const mixedData = new MixedModel({
  anyField: { anything: 'I want', number: 42, array: [1, 2, 3] }
});

mixedData.save().then(() => console.log('Saved data with mixed types!'));

```


Mongoose's schema-based approach is one of its defining features, offering advantages like validation and type casting. However, if you prefer working directly with the MongoDB driver without a predefined schema for ALL collections (instead of a particular collection), you might consider using the native MongoDB Node.js driver instead.
