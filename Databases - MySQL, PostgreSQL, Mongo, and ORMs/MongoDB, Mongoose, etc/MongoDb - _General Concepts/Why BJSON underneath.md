Which is faster, BSON or JSON? In a vacuum, BSON can be faster than JSON for large and complex data structures because of its binary encoding and compactness.

Does MongoDB use BSON or JSON? MongoDB stores data in BSON format both internally, and over the network, but that doesn't mean you can't think of MongoDB as a JSON database. Anything you can represent in JSON can be natively stored in MongoDB, and retrieved just as easily in JSON.

Proof has BJSON:
```
from bson import ObjectId  
  
# Assuming 'users' is your collection  
user = users.find_one_and_update(  
    {"_id": ObjectId("6565adfe2a09e7ad149c95bf")},   
    {"$set": {"narrationFile": processed["filepath"]}}  
)
```
