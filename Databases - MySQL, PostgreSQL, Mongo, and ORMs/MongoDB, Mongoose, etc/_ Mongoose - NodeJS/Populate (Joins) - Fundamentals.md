In Mongoose, how to populate events that are tied to users? Please show model and mongoose code. Assume express server with API endpoints / routes. Thanks

To populate events tied to users, you would have to define a reference in your Mongoose model. The following is an example of how you could define your User and Event models:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const eventSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    date: Date,
    // additional fields
});

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    email: String,
    events: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Event' }],
    // additional fields
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
const Event = mongoose.model('Event', eventSchema);
```

In the `User` schema, the `events` field is an array of ObjectIds. The ObjectId is the unique identifier generated for each document in MongoDB. The `ref: 'Event'` tells Mongoose which model to use during population. 

After you've defined your models, you can use the `populate()` method in mongoose to tie the models together. Here's an example of a route that gets a user along with their events:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/users/:userId', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const user = await User.findById(req.params.userId).populate('events');
        res.json(user);
    } catch (err) {
        res.status(500).json({ message: err.message });
    }
});

module.exports = router;
```

In this example, `User.findById(req.params.userId).populate('events')` will find a user by their ID, then replace the `events` field with the actual events from the `Event` model.

Note: The actual route and model design may vary depending on your application's requirements.
