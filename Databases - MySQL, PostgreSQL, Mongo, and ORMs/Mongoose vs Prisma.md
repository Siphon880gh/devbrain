**Mongoose** is a popular ODM (Object Data Modeling) library specifically built for **MongoDB**, a NoSQL database. **Prisma**, on the other hand, is a next-generation ORM that is **primarily designed for relational databases** like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite—but it also supports MongoDB.

#### Choosing Between Mongoose and Prisma

The first step in deciding which one to use is understanding what type of database your project needs:

- If you're going with **MongoDB**, Mongoose is a natural choice—it’s tightly integrated with Mongo and has been around for a long time.
    
- If you want more flexibility or are using a **relational database**, Prisma is often the better option.
    

#### Can Prisma Be Used with MongoDB?

Yes! Prisma does support MongoDB, and for many use cases, it works perfectly fine. Some features—like many-to-many relationships—require a bit of extra setup compared to how Mongoose handles them, but it's manageable.

#### Why Some Developers Prefer Prisma

Even though Mongoose is great for MongoDB, Prisma has a major advantage: **it abstracts your database layer**, allowing you to switch databases with minimal code changes. Mongoose is locked into MongoDB, while Prisma supports multiple databases. This cross-compatibility can be a lifesaver.

You might wonder:

> _"Who even switches databases mid-development?"_

Surprisingly, it happens more often than you'd think. Some projects start out with flexible NoSQL storage (like MongoDB) when the schema isn’t fully defined. Later, once the data model stabilizes, they switch to a relational database (like PostgreSQL) for stronger structure, performance, or relational features.
