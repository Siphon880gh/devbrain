The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table. Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values. A table can have only ONE primary key; and in the table, this primary key can consist of single or multiple columns (fields).

The Primary Key serves several important purposes:
- Uniqueness: Ensures that each row in a table is unique. This is crucial for accurately identifying a specific record.
- Indexing: Primary keys are automatically indexed in most database systems. This index speeds up queries that search the table based on the primary key.
- Referential Integrity: In relational databases, primary keys play a crucial role in relationships between tables. Foreign keys in other tables refer to the primary key to maintain referential integrity.
- Non-Nullability: Since a primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table, it must have a value in every row. This is why primary keys cannot be NULL.
- Composite Key: When a primary key is made up of multiple columns, it's known as a composite key. This is useful when a single column can't uniquely identify records.
  
Remember, while designing a database, it's important to choose the primary key wisely, considering factors like the stability and uniqueness of the column(s) involved.
