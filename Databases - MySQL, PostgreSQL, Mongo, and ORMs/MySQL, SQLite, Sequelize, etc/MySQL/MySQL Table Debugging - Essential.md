MySQL Table Debugging - Essential

```
SHOW CREATE TABLE `<yourtable>`;
```

```
DESCRIBE Roles
```

In MySQL, you can use the `SHOW CREATE TABLE` statement to see how a table was created. This statement displays the CREATE TABLE statement that was used to create the specified table.

Here's the syntax:

```
SHOW CREATE TABLE table_name;
```

Replace `table_name` with the name of the table you want to examine.

Here's an example:

```
SHOW CREATE TABLE employees;
```

This will retrieve the CREATE TABLE statement for the "employees" table. The result will include the table's name, column definitions, indexes, and any other table options that were specified during the creation.

Note that in order to execute this command, you need the necessary privileges to access the database and view table definitions.

Yes, the `SHOW CREATE TABLE` statement and the `DESCRIBE TABLE` statement serve different purposes.

The `SHOW CREATE TABLE` statement displays the actual SQL statement that was used to create the specified table. It provides a detailed view of the table's structure, including column definitions, indexes, and any other options that were specified during its creation. This statement is useful when you need to understand the exact configuration of a table.

On the other hand, the `DESCRIBE TABLE` statement (or simply `DESC`) provides a concise summary of the table's structure. It returns information about the columns in the table, including the column names, data types, nullability, and any indexes defined on the table. This statement is typically used to quickly inspect the structure of a table without showing the complete SQL statement used to create it.

In summary, `SHOW CREATE TABLE` provides the full CREATE TABLE statement, while `DESCRIBE TABLE` provides a summary of the table's structure.
