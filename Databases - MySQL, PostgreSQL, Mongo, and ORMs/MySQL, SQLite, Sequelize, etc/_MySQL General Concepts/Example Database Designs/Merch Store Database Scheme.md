Designing a database schema for an online merchandise store involves considering various entities such as products, users, orders, and possibly reviews and ratings. Here's a simplified version of what the schema could look like:

    - UserID (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each user.
    - Username: The user's chosen username.
    - Email: The user's email address.
    - Password: The user's encrypted password.
    - CreateDate: The date the account was created.

2. **Products Table**: This table will store information about the merchandise.
    - ProductID (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each product.
    - Name: The name of the product.
    - Description: Details about the product.
    - Price: The cost of the product.
    - StockQuantity: Number of items in stock.
    - AddedDate: When the product was added to the store.

3. **Orders Table**: This table will store information about the orders.
    - OrderID (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each order.
    - UserID (Foreign Key): The ID of the user who placed the order.
    - OrderDate: The date the order was placed.
    - Status: The current status of the order (e.g., "shipped", "pending", "delivered").

4. **OrderDetails Table**: This table breaks down the orders into individual items.
    - OrderDetailID (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each order detail line.
    - OrderID (Foreign Key): The ID of the order.
    - ProductID (Foreign Key): The ID of the product ordered.
    - Quantity: The number of products ordered.
    - Price: The price of the product at the time of ordering.

5. **Reviews Table** (optional): This table will store product reviews by users.
    - ReviewID (Primary Key): A unique identifier for each review.
    - ProductID (Foreign Key): The ID of the product being reviewed.

This design assumes a relatively simple merch store. Depending on your needs, you might want to add more features, like categories for products, address tables for shipping, transaction tables for payments, etc. Remember, the specifics can vary greatly depending on the scale and functionality of the store.
