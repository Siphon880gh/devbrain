Your engineering teams can post to a URL the json representing the Postman Collection. Like:

And it could be version controlled with only one person responsible for merging suggestions to the API endpoint

> [!note] **Want to practice importing a Postman Collection via URL?**  
> Try the **“Download our Web Scraper API Postman Collection”** from Oxylabs. It’s a free resource that lets you explore their API endpoints. _(Note: Technically you’ll need an API key for full responses, but getting an Unauthorized message is enough for our purposes of veriying that we successfully imported and tested a Postman Collection via URL because it reached their API endpoints denying access.)_

Postman → File → Import
Copy that URL there

A collection is also created (will be determined by that import's json)
