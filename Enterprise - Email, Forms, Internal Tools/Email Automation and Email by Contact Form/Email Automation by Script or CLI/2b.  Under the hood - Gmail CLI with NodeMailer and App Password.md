### üîç Under the Hood: `service: "gmail"` in Nodemailer

When you specify `service: "gmail"` in `nodemailer.createTransport()`, you're using a built-in shortcut that tells Nodemailer to automatically configure the correct SMTP settings for Gmail.

Behind the scenes, Nodemailer maps `"gmail"` to:

```js
{
  host: "smtp.gmail.com",
  port: 465, // or 587
  secure: true // true for port 465, false for 587
}
```

So instead of manually specifying the `host`, `port`, and `secure` options, you're letting Nodemailer use Gmail's official SMTP server configuration.

### üåê SMTP and Your Local Machine

- When you send an email using this transport, your **local machine (Mac/Linux)** connects to Gmail‚Äôs SMTP server over the internet.
- The connection is made using **TCP on port 465 (SSL) or 587 (STARTTLS)**, depending on how Gmail's server expects it.
- Most systems (MacOS, Linux, etc.) allow outbound connections on these ports by default, so **no special firewall or port opening is needed** unless you're on a highly restricted network.    
- Gmail requires **authentication via your email and app password**‚Äînot your normal Gmail password‚Äîfor CLI or script-based sending.
