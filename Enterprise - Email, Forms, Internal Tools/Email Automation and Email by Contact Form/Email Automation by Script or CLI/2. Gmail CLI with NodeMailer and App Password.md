Send emails directly from the command line using Node.js, Gmail, and an app password—ideal for automations and terminal-based workflows.

For a contact form that connects to the backend nodemailer, refer to [[Send Email as Owner from a Website Form Using Personal Gmail, App Password, and Nodemailer]]

### ✅ Example Usage

Run either of the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm start wff1012@hotmail.com "test2" "this is a second email test"
```

or

```bash
node app.js wff1012@hotmail.com "test2" "this is a second email test"
```

**What the recipient sees:**
- Let's keep this example to hotmail aka Outlook since that's the recipient email address in my example terminal command.

### 🔐 Requirements

> Gmail requires **authentication using your email address and an app password**, not your regular Gmail password, when sending from a CLI or script. Alternatives like a **Google service account JSON key** (via the Gmail API) or **OAuth2** with a consent screen can also be used—but those are typically implemented in full applications, not simple CLI tools.
>

- You must set up a **Gmail app password**.  
    👉 Follow the steps in [[1. Create Gmail app password]].

### 📁 File Structure

```
.
├── .env.json
├── app.js
├── package.json
└── node_modules/
    ├── dotenv/
    └── nodemailer/
```

### 📜 `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "email-sender",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "CLI tool to send emails via Gmail",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "dotenv": "^16.5.0",
    "nodemailer": "^7.0.3"
  }
}
```


---

### 📦 Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Create a `.env` file:**
```ini
gmailEmailAddress="<YOUR_GMAIL_ADDRESS>"
gmailAppPassword="<YOUR_APP_PASSWORD>"
```

---

### 📂 `app.js`

```js
require("dotenv").config();
const nodemailer = require("nodemailer");

// CLI arguments
const args = process.argv.slice(2);
if (args.length < 3) {
  console.log("Usage: node app.js <recipient_email> <subject> <message>");
  process.exit(1);
}

const [recipient, subject, message] = args;

// Setup Gmail transporter
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: "gmail",
  auth: {
    user: process.env.gmailEmailAddress || "",
    pass: process.env.gmailAppPassword || ""
  }
});

// Mail options
const mailOptions = {
  from: process.env.gmailEmailAddress,
  to: recipient,
  subject,
  text: message
};

// Send email
transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (err, info) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Error:", err);
  } else {
    console.log("Email sent:", info.response);
  }
});
```

### 🧠 How It Works

The script reads your Gmail credentials from `.env`, then uses `nodemailer` to send an email using the arguments you pass.

---

### 🏁 Usage

You can run your script using either:

```bash
node app.js <email> <subject> <message>
```

or:

```bash
npm start <email> <subject> <message>
```

Both work because `npm start` runs the `node app.js` command and passes any additional arguments as is NodeJS' default behavior with npm scripts.

---

### 🧠 WARNING

- The script reads your Gmail credentials from `.env`, then uses `nodemailer` to send an email using the arguments you pass. Make sure to keep your .env safe, especially since it contains your Gmail app password.

- When emailing out to another domain than your own, make sure to not email too many, to include links or images or html in the first email, etc - so to not affect your email domain's reputation and deliverability. Make sure not to send out emails too frequently in a short time either.
