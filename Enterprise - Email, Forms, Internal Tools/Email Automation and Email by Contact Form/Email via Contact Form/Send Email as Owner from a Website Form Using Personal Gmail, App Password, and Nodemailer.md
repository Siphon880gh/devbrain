If your website form collects user submissions, you’ll likely send the data from your own domain email—either your own or an employee’s—to keep everything consistent and manageable. Typically, you’ll send the form results back to an address on your domain, which helps maintain deliverability.

### 1. Sending Form Submissions from Your Domain

When a user submits a form on your website, the resulting email should be sent from an address on your own domain—typically your own or an employee’s. Ideally, the recipient is also on the same domain. This keeps communication organized, especially if you manage multiple domains, and helps preserve your deliverability score. Emails sent within the same domain, or even to the same email address (i.e., sender and recipient are the same), are less likely to be flagged or penalized.

Make sure the user’s email address is collected from the form and included in the email body so you can follow up. If this is your first time contacting them, avoid using HTML, images, or links in the initial message, as these can negatively affect deliverability.

If you prefer the message to appear as if it came directly from the user’s personal Gmail account, see:  
**[[Send Email as Visitor from a Website Form Using Personal Gmail, OAuth2, and Nodemailer]]**  
This method has an advantage: when you receive the email, it will look like the visitor emailed you directly—so your reply (with links or rich content) won’t trigger any deliverability penalties.

### 2. CLI Emailer Using Owner's Gmail

We’ve created a CLI-based email sender that uses the owner’s Gmail address. You can adapt it into a full stack solution with a contact form. The approach would be to wrap the CLI in a backend endpoint. See:  [[2a. Gmail CLI with NodeMailer and App Password]]

✋ Once that's working, continue on the rest of this guide to complete the setup.

### 3. Connecting to a Frontend (Safely)

Although you _can_ connect your email script directly to a frontend form, it’s risky. Abuse (like spam submissions) could damage your sender reputation and reduce email deliverability with services like Gmail, Outlook, or Yahoo.

**Best practice:**  
Have the frontend submit data to a message queue. Then use a backend script to:

- Run periodically (e.g., hourly)
- Filter spam or duplicate submissions
- Send emails in controlled batches to avoid deliverability penalties

**Note:**  
If you’re sending emails _to yourself_ (i.e., sender and recipient are the same), Gmail typically delivers them instantly and without penalty.
