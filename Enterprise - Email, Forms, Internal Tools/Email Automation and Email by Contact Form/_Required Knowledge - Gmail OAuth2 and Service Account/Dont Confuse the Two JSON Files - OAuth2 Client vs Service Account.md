When working with Google APIs like Gmail, Drive, or Sheets, your app needs to authenticate itself. Google provides **two distinct types of JSON credentials**, each suited for a different use case:

- **OAuth2 Client JSON File** – for **user-based** access (e.g. logging in with Gmail)
- **Service Account JSON File** – for **server-to-server** access (e.g. reading a Sheet in the background)

And Google's services may limit you to specific types of JSON Files for authorization:
- **OAuth2 Client JSON File** - For personal Gmail accounts. Example: Sending email as a logged-in user (`you@gmail.com`)
- **Service Account JSON File** – For Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) organizations, which does **not** support personal Gmail accounts anyways and requires domain-wide delegation and admin setup.

Understanding the difference is critical to avoid misusing them.

### 🔐 OAuth2 Client JSON (User Login Flow)

To send emails through Gmail or access a user’s data, you must authenticate **on behalf of a user** using **OAuth2**.

#### 📝 Step 1: Identify Your App with OAuth2 Credentials

1. Go to **Google Cloud Console > APIs & Services > Credentials**
    
2. Create an **OAuth Client ID**
    
    - Application type: **Desktop App** or **Web App**
        
3. Download the `.json` file — it contains:
    
    - `client_id`
    - `client_secret`
    - `redirect_uris`

This file is used to **start the OAuth2 login flow** — it proves your app’s identity to Google.

#### 🌐 Step 2: User Logs In and Grants Access

Once the OAuth client is initialized, your backend generates an authorization URL. The flow looks like this:

- The user visits the link and sees Google’s **consent screen**
    
- After granting permission, Google redirects to your callback with a `?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE`
    
- You use a Google SDK to exchange the code for:
    
    - `access_token` (short-lived, for API access)
    - `refresh_token` (optional, for silent re-auth)
    - `expiry_date` (when the access token expires)
        

> ✅ These tokens are **returned dynamically at runtime** — they’re not in the original JSON file.

### 🛑 Service Account JSON (No User Login)

Service accounts are for **server-to-server** operations where **no user login or consent is required**.

- Created under **Google Cloud > Credentials > Service Accounts**
    
- You download a different `.json` file — it contains:
    
    - `client_email`
    - `private_key`
    - `project_id`, etc.
        

These are used for use cases like:

- Automating Google Sheets, Drive, or Cloud Storage
- Running background jobs
- Admin-level access within a **Google Workspace** domain
    

> ⚠️ You **cannot** use service account JSON with a regular `@gmail.com` address.  
> It only works in **Google Workspace** domains, and even then, only if **domain-wide delegation** is configured.

### ✅ Credential Types Compared

|Type|Purpose|Works with Gmail?|File Format|
|---|---|---|---|
|**OAuth2 Client JSON**|User login + consent (OAuth2 flow)|✅ Yes (standard Gmail)|`.json`|
|**OAuth2 Tokens**|Returned _after_ login + consent|✅ Yes|In-memory or stored|
|**Service Account JSON**|Server-to-server, no user involved|🚫 No (unless Workspace + delegation)|`.json`|
