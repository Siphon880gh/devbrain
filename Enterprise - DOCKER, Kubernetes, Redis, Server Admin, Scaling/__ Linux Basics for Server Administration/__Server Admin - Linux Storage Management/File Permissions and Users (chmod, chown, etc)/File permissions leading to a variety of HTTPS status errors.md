When Nginx encounters a file with incorrect permissions, it will not be able to access the file. This usually results in an error being displayed on the webpage. The specific error depends on the type of permission issue:

1. **403 Forbidden Error**: This error occurs when Nginx has read access to the file but the permissions are not set to allow the web server to serve the file to the user. It typically means that the file exists, but Nginx is not allowed to read it.

   Example:
   ```
   403 Forbidden
   ```

2. **500 Internal Server Error**: This error can occur if there are other issues related to file permissions or ownership, particularly with scripts (like PHP) that Nginx tries to execute via a backend server (such as PHP-FPM). This could mean that the script cannot be executed due to permission issues.

   Example:
   ```
   500 Internal Server Error
   ```

3. **404 Not Found Error**: If the permissions are such that Nginx cannot even see the file (because it does not have execute permission on the directories leading to the file), Nginx may assume the file does not exist.

   Example:
   ```
   404 Not Found
   ```

### Troubleshooting File Permission Issues

To troubleshoot and fix file permission issues:

1. **Check the file permissions**:
   Ensure that the file has the correct read permissions for the web server user (typically `www-data` on Debian-based systems or `nginx` on Red Hat-based systems).

   ```bash
   sudo chmod 644 /path/to/your/file
   sudo chown www-data:www-data /path/to/your/file
   ```

   The above commands set the file to be readable and writable by the owner, and readable by everyone else.

2. **Check the directory permissions**:
   Ensure that the directories leading to the file have execute permissions so Nginx can traverse them.

   ```bash
   sudo chmod 755 /path/to/your/directory
   sudo chown www-data:www-data /path/to/your/directory
   ```

3. **Check the Nginx error log**:
   Nginx error logs often contain helpful information regarding permission issues.

   ```bash
   sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
   ```

By ensuring the proper permissions and ownership are set on your files and directories, you can avoid these errors and allow Nginx to serve your files correctly.
