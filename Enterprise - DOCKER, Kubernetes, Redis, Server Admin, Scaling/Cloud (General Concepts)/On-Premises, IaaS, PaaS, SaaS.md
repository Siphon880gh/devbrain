As a small nonprofit, WPS started with a SaaS model. While this move brings technology efficiencies and cost savings, the SaaS model can also raise issues. “If we choose a provider that has a great tool we want to work with, we have to be concerned if the tool will be available in the future” because the provider might discontinue it or go out of business altogether, says Matt Morrisette, a software engineer for the organization. WPS is also running into non-SaaS issues where it needs regional support to ensure it remains in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation, better known as GDPR, the law on data protection and privacy in the EU, as its operations expand into new areas. “If you don’t host your data in Europe, you can’t launch projects there,” Morrisette  

says. “These were things we didn’t really think about when we initially launched, but now it’s become an issue. We are trying to be more flexible in how we launch AI projects now.” Large enterprises might start with SaaS but move to an IaaS or PaaS model. The choice will be driven by the size of the company, the agility requirements, the available talent, and the use case for the technology. For some use cases, the decision is dictated by the lack of off-the-shelf SaaS solutions. “The one big lightbulb for me was to understand that there was no off-the-shelf, one-size-fits-all solution that’s available out there today unless you’re in a fairly commodity industry,” Lopes says. Most of the top data-centric organizations are using the cloud to leverage more IaaS and PaaS capabilities, taking advantage of the speed and agility of these models to innovate where they could not have done so with traditional technologies, while reducing costs
