The command `sudo ufw status` is used to check the status of the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) on a system. It shows what remote sources can connect to which ports for downloading or uploading and whether it's through TCP or UDP.


It's usually installed on Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the command:

- **sudo**: This prefix runs the command with superuser (root) privileges. UFW requires administrative access to modify firewall settings and view their status.
- **ufw**: This is the command-line interface for the Uncomplicated Firewall.
- **status**: This option requests the current status of the firewall, showing whether it is active or inactive and displaying the configured rules.

When you run `sudo ufw status`, you might see output like this:

Status: active

--                         ------      ----
22                         ALLOW       Anywhere
80                         ALLOW       Anywhere
443                        ALLOW       Anywhere
22 (v6)                    ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
80 (v6)                    ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
443 (v6)                   ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

443/tcp                    ALLOW       Anywhere                  
8443/tcp                   ALLOW       Anywhere                  
22/tcp                     ALLOW       Anywhere                  
49152:65534/tcp            ALLOW       209.65.62.26              
20:21/tcp                  ALLOW       Anywhere                  
49152:65534/tcp            ALLOW       Anywhere                  
443/udp                    ALLOW       Anywhere                  
80/tcp (v6)                ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)             
443/tcp (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)             
8443/tcp (v6)              ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)             
22/tcp (v6)                ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)             
443/udp (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)  
```

### Explanation of the Output:

- **Status: active**: Indicates that the firewall is currently active. If it says "inactive," it means the firewall is turned off.
- **To/From**: These columns show the ports or services being allowed or denied, and the source from which traffic is being allowed or denied.
- **Action**: This column indicates what action is taken (e.g., ALLOW or DENY).
- **Anywhere**: Specifies that the rule applies to all IP addresses. `(v6)` indicates that the rule applies to IPv6 traffic.

### Examples of Other Outputs:

- If the firewall is inactive, you might see:
  ```plaintext
  Status: inactive
  ```

- If there are no rules configured, but the firewall is active, you might see:
  ```plaintext
  Status: active

  To                         Action      From
  --                         ------      ----
  ```

### Common Actions:

- To enable UFW, you would use: `sudo ufw enable`
- To disable UFW, you would use: `sudo ufw disable`
- To allow a specific port, such as SSH on port 22: `sudo ufw allow 22`
- To deny a specific port: `sudo ufw deny 22`

Using `sudo ufw status` regularly can help you keep track of your firewall settings and ensure that your system is protected as intended.
