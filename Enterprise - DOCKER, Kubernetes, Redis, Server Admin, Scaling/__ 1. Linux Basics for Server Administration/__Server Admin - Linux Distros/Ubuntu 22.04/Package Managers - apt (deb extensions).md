Ubuntu 22.04, like all versions of Ubuntu, uses the `apt` package management system. The `apt` system (Advanced Package Tool) is used for handling the installation, removal, and management of software packages. It manages dependencies and retrieves packages from configured repositories. Ubuntu's system is based on `.deb` packages, rather than the `.rpm` packages used in RPM-based distributions like CentOS or Fedora.

The `apt` system provides commands like `apt-get`, `apt-cache`, and `apt-config` for various package management tasks, and Ubuntu also includes a more user-friendly command, `apt`, which combines the most commonly used features from other `apt-*` commands in a streamlined manner.

## Namesake

The naming convention in Ubuntu and Debian systems—where the package management system is called "APT" (Advanced Package Tool) but the packages themselves have the `.deb` file extension—can indeed seem a bit confusing at first. Here's a brief explanation to clarify this:

1. **.deb Files**: The `.deb` file extension is used for software packages in Debian and its derivatives, including Ubuntu. This format was developed by Debian and hence the name "deb" is derived from "Debian". It encapsulates the files needed to install a software application onto a Debian-compatible system.

2. **APT (Advanced Package Tool)**: APT, on the other hand, is the package management system that automates the process of handling packages, including installation, upgrade, and removal. APT uses `.deb` files, but it does much more than just handle these files individually. It manages dependencies, updates, and the integration of complex software systems, ensuring that all parts of the software work harmoniously without the user needing to manually manage each individual package.

In summary, `.deb` files are the format of the packages, and APT is the tool used to manage these packages. The distinction between the package format and the management tool helps in separating the roles within the system: one for package format and another for management logistics.
