`apt` and `apt-get` are both command-line tools used to manage packages on Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, but they serve slightly different purposes and offer different user experiences.

### `apt`
- **Introduced:** In Ubuntu 16.04 and Debian 8 (Jessie) as a more user-friendly and consolidated tool.
- **Purpose:** Combines the most commonly used commands from `apt-get` and `apt-cache` into a single command. It is designed to be simpler and more straightforward for everyday package management tasks.
- **Common Commands:**
  - `apt update`: Updates the package lists.
  - `apt upgrade`: Upgrades all upgradable packages.
  - `apt install [package]`: Installs a package.
  - `apt remove [package]`: Removes a package.
  - `apt search [package]`: Searches for a package.
  - `apt show [package]`: Displays detailed information about a package.
- **Features:** `apt` provides a more user-friendly output, including progress bars, clearer messaging, and automatic prompts for required confirmations.

### `apt-get`
- **Introduced:** In 1998, as part of APT (Advanced Package Tool), it has been the traditional package manager for Debian-based systems.
- **Purpose:** It offers more advanced and granular options than `apt`, and is still widely used in scripts and for more complex package management tasks.
- **Common Commands:**
  - `apt-get update`: Updates the package lists.
  - `apt-get upgrade`: Upgrades all upgradable packages.
  - `apt-get install [package]`: Installs a package.
  - `apt-get remove [package]`: Removes a package.
  - `apt-get dist-upgrade`: Upgrades packages while intelligently handling dependencies (can add or remove packages).
  - `apt-get autoremove`: Removes unnecessary packages that were automatically installed to satisfy dependencies for other packages and are no longer needed.
  - `apt-get purge [package]`: Removes a package along with its configuration files.
- **Features:** `apt-get` is more suited for scripting because of its stability and backward compatibility. It doesn’t include some of the user-friendly features of `apt`, like progress bars.

### Summary
- **Use `apt`** for day-to-day package management tasks; it’s simpler, has a cleaner interface, and is designed for interactive use.
- **Use `apt-get`** for scripting, advanced package management, or when you need options that aren’t available with `apt`. 

Both tools ultimately serve similar purposes, but `apt` is recommended for interactive use, while `apt-get` is better suited for scripts and automation tasks.
