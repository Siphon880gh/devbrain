Xen usually the choice when you have hardware virtualization but do not have KVM type hardware virtualization. Or... your dedicated server is virtualized by the web host provider and they didn't enable nested virtualization.

Xen supports multiple types of virtualization and hypervisors. Here's a breakdown:

### 1. **Types of Virtualization:**
   - **Full Virtualization (HVM - Hardware Virtual Machine):** 
     - This type of virtualization is where the guest operating system is completely unmodified and unaware that it is being virtualized. Xen uses hardware extensions (like Intel VT-x or AMD-V) to support this. The hardware extensions allow Xen to trap and emulate privileged operations that the guest OS might try to execute.
   
   - **Paravirtualization (PV):**
     - In this type of virtualization, the guest operating system is aware that it is running in a virtualized environment and is modified to work with the hypervisor. This leads to better performance, especially on hardware that doesn't have virtualization extensions, because the guest OS avoids many of the traps and emulation that occur in full virtualization.

### 2. **Types of Hypervisors:**
   - **Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-metal):**
     - Xen is primarily a Type 1 hypervisor, meaning it runs directly on the host's hardware, and it manages guest operating systems at a high level. It doesn't rely on a host operating system, which allows for better performance and more efficient use of resources.
   
   - **Type 2 Hypervisor:**
     - Although Xen is generally a Type 1 hypervisor, certain configurations can make it operate similarly to a Type 2 hypervisor, which runs on top of a host operating system. However, this is not the common use case for Xen.

### 3. **Hardware Virtualization Extensions:**
   - **Intel VT-x and AMD-V:**
     - These are the hardware virtualization extensions that Xen leverages for full virtualization (HVM). These extensions are crucial for efficiently running unmodified guest operating systems with Xen.

Xen can utilize both full virtualization and paravirtualization depending on the specific use case and hardware capabilities.
