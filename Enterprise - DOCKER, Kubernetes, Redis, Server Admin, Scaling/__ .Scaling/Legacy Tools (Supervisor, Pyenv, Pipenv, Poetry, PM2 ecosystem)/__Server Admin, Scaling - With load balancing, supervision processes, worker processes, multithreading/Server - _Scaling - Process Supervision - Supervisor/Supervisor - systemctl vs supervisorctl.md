For supervisor, are these both the same? They both help me shutdown supervisor (important when I changed configurations and need to start supervisor after shutting down supervisor)
`sudo supervisorctl shutdown`
`sudo systemctl shutdown supervisor`

Yes, you can use either command to shut down Supervisor, but they operate through different mechanisms and might have slightly different effects depending on your system's configuration and what exactly you want to achieve. Here's a brief comparison to help you decide which one to use:

1. **`sudo supervisorctl shutdown`**:
   - Directly communicates with the Supervisor daemon.
   - Gracefully shuts down all managed processes before shutting down the Supervisor itself.
   - Recommended if you want to ensure that Supervisor's internal state and managed processes are properly handled during shutdown.

2. **`sudo systemctl shutdown supervisor`**:
   - Uses the system's service manager (`systemd` in this case) to stop the Supervisor service.
   - Stops the Supervisor service as defined in the system's service unit files.
   - Recommended if you are managing services using `systemd` and want to follow the system's standard way of managing services.

In most cases, if you want to ensure that all processes managed by Supervisor are properly stopped, `sudo supervisorctl shutdown` is the preferred method. However, if you are managing multiple services with `systemd` and prefer a consistent approach across all services, you can use `sudo systemctl shutdown supervisor`.
