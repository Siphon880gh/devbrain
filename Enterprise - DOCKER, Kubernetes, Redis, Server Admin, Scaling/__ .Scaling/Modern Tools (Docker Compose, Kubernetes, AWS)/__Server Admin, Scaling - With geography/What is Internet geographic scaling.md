Internet geographic scaling refers to the design of the internet to serve a global user base while ensuring that applications load quickly. It involves distributing content and data as close to the user as possible, and processing as much as possible even closer to the user. 

Here are some ways the internet scales geographically:

- **IPv6 addressing**: This system can address a trillion times more devices than are currently connected to the internet. 
- **Dynamic routing**: New routers can join a network at any time to help move data packets. 
- **Load balancing**: Global load balancing can be used to distribute core services and data across geographic regions. 
- **Processing**: Processing can be done as close to the user as possible, such as for static content. 
- **Threat mitigation**: Threats can be headed off as close to their source as possible. 

The geographic properties of the internet are also studied for economic, political, and legal reasons. For example, the internet can have different economic consequences in different locations because of local factors.
