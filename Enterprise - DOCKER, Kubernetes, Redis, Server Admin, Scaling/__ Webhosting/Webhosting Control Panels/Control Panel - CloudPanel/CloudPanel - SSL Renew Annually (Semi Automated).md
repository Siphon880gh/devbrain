**Requirements**: 
You know how to renew your SSL through Let's Encrypt at Cloud Panel already

Here you'll learn a semi automated way to renew your certificate.

---

**Problem**:
You're renewing the SSL/TLS certificate for HTTPS in CloudPanel. You may see an old certificate that's expired or no longer relevant—especially if you're adding new domains or subdomains to the web host for public access, which requires HTTPS.

But when you create a new SSL... unfortunately it wont remember your old domains. You have to manually type them in:

You wish you have a list of domains and subdomains that can just enter automatically into these fields for you (And click "Add Domain" as needed). You're in lucky. That's what this doc is for.

**DevTools script:**


Have a list of the domains/subdomains in the wildcard code. Paste the entire code snippet into Google Chrome DevTools console. It'll automatically create the the needed number of textfields (by programmatically clicking the "Add Domain" button) and it'll fill them in with your domain/subdomains

```
var wildcards = [  
    "wengindustry.com",   
    "www.wengindustry.com",  
    "wengindustries.com",   
    "www.wengindustries.com",   
    "3dnotes.wengindustry.com",   
    "3dnotes.wengindustries.com",   
    "biznotes.wengindustry.com",   
    "biznotes.wengindustries.com",   
    "codernotes.wengindustry.com",   
    "codernotes.wengindustries.com",   
    "healthnotes.wengindustry.com",   
    "healthnotes.wengindustries.com",   
    "ctrl-tw-pm.wengindustry.com",   
    "ctrl-tw-pm.wengindustries.com",   
    "therunner.app",   
    "www.therunner.app",  
    "nursing.icu",   
    "www.nursing.icu"  
]  
  
// Create text fields  
var prefilledAlready = document.querySelectorAll(".domain-input").length;  
for(var i=0; i<wildcards.length-prefilledAlready+1; i++) {  
    document.querySelector("#add-domain-name").click();  
}  
  
// Fill text fields  
document.querySelectorAll(".domain-input input").forEach((el,i)=>{  
 if(i<wildcards.length) {  
   el.value = wildcards[i];  
 }  
});
```

The textfields will be created and filled in with your desired subdomains and domains. Save this snippet somewhere save for you to renew whenever the Let's Encrypt expires.
