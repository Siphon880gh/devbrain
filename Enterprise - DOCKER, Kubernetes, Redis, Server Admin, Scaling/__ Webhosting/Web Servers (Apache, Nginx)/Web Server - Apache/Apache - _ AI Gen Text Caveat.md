As of 11/2024, AI like ChatGPT and Claude may mislead when asking for htaccess or apache rules. Here are some things to keep in mind:
- When asking AI about htaccess and it gives you solution, check with it that it works in htacces or is it for an Apache config file.
- Ask if it's for Apache 2.4 or higher or lower. Syntax widely changes.
