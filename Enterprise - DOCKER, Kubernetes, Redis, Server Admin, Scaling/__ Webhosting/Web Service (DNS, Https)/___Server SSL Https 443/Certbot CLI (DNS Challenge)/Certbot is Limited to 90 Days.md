Certbox SSL/TLS certificates expire every 90 days. If you prefer a longer-term “set it and forget it” solution, you’ll need to purchase a certificate valid for a year or more.

To avoid service disruptions, it's recommended to automate the renewal process and schedule it a few days before the 90-day expiration—around day 87 is a safe margin. This gives you time to catch and fix any potential HTTPS issues.

Option: Buy a **1-year wildcard SSL** from a provider like **Namecheap** or **SSLs.com**
