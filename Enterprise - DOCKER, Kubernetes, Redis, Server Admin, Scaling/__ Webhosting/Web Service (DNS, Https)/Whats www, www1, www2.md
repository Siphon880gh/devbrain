**Firstly, what is the point of the www subdomain?**

The subdomain is what goes before the SLD (Second level domain). The most common subdomain is www, which stands for World Wide Web. This subdomain **contains a website's homepage and its most important pages**. The www subdomain is so widely used that most domain registrars include it with domain name purchase

You might come across URLs like “www1.website.com” or “www2.website.com” (and even notice the www1.domain.com server name in a CloudPanel site's vhost) and wonder if they're sketchy. **In most—but certainly not all—cases, they're benign**. These prefixes indicate multiple servers behind a popular website, helping balance the traffic.

### ✅ When `www1` **might be worth it**:

- **You actively load balance across multiple subdomains** (e.g., `www1`, `www2`) for legacy apps.
- You **need it for specific DNS routing or traffic segmentation** (e.g., a CDN that uses subdomains for geo-distribution).
- You are serving **distinct content or testing environments** on `www1` vs. `www`.

---

### ❌ When it's **not worth it** (most cases):

- You're **not doing multi-subdomain load balancing**.
- Your app is **served entirely from `example.com` or `www.example.com`**.
- It adds **VHost duplication** or confusion in SSL, redirect logic, or cookies.
- You don’t want users to see confusing domains like `www1`.

### ✅ Recommendation

If you're aiming for simplicity:

1. **Redirect `www1.example.com` → `example.com`** or `www.example.com`.
2. Remove the `server_name www1.example.com` block in your vhost.
3. Make sure DNS no longer points to `www1`.
