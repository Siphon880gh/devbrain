### CentOS
- **Update Frequency**: CentOS has long times between updates, which makes it a stable and reliable option for enterprise environments where stability is crucial. But it is not ideal for cutting edge when you're implementing new tech all the time

### Ubuntu
- **Update Frequency**: Ubuntu offers frequent updates and regular releases, including LTS (Long-Term Support) versions which are supported for five years.
- It comes included with many useful tools and "just works"

### Debian
- **Update Frequency**: Debian strikes a balance with a stable release cycle and occasional updates, making it reliable yet relatively up-to-date.
- It comes barebones and requires some setup like installing setup, fixing vim editor, etc. You'd refer to [[Debian breaking into new shoes]]

Proxmox for KVM hardware virtualization of VMs as VPS? (Dup)
- Is based on Debian 12. Would crash on other systems including Ubuntu
	- "Is it possible to install proxmox on Ubuntu? Sure, just add the proxmox repos, apt update, apt install proxmox...and enjoy repairing everything that will break. Proxmox is based on Debian."
