**Customizing Text Color in Node.js Console Applications**

When developing Node.js applications, adding color to console output can greatly enhance readability and user experience. By incorporating ANSI escape codes, developers can infuse their console logs with a spectrum of colors and styles. This article provides a concise guide on how to apply these color codes in your Node.js applications.

To start, consider a basic example where you want to print text in cyan color:

```javascript
console.log('\x1b[36m%s\x1b[0m', 'I am cyan');  // Output: cyan text
```

In this snippet, `\x1b[36m` initiates the cyan color, and `%s` is a placeholder that gets replaced with the subsequent argument, in this case, 'I am cyan'. After the text, `\x1b[0m` is used to reset the color, preventing subsequent console output from also being in cyan.

To print a variable in yellow, you can use:

```javascript
console.log('\x1b[33m%s\x1b[0m', stringToMakeYellow);  // Output: yellow text
```

Here's a quick reference for various text styles and colors you can use:

- **Styles**:
  - Reset: `"\x1b[0m"`
  - Bright: `"\x1b[1m"`
  - Dim: `"\x1b[2m"`
  - Underscore: `"\x1b[4m"`
  - Blink: `"\x1b[5m"`
  - Reverse: `"\x1b[7m"`
  - Hidden: `"\x1b[8m"`

- **Foreground Colors**:
  - Black: `"\x1b[30m"`
  - Red: `"\x1b[31m"`
  - Green: `"\x1b[32m"`
  - Yellow: `"\x1b[33m"`
  - Blue: `"\x1b[34m"`
  - Magenta: `"\x1b[35m"`
  - Cyan: `"\x1b[36m"`
  - White: `"\x1b[37m"`
  - Gray: `"\x1b[90m"`

- **Background Colors**:
  - Black: `"\x1b[40m"`
  - Red: `"\x1b[41m"`
  - Green: `"\x1b[42m"`
  - Yellow: `"\x1b[43m"`
  - Blue: `"\x1b[44m"`
  - Magenta: `"\x1b[45m"`
  - Cyan: `"\x1b[46m"`
  - White: `"\x1b[47m"`
  - Gray: `"\x1b[100m"`

Understanding the code: `\x1b[31m` is an escape sequence that signals the terminal to change the text color to red. `\x1b` represents the escape character, a non-printable control character. These sequences, known as ANSI escape codes, are standardized, ensuring compatibility across different platforms.

By leveraging these codes, developers can create more engaging and visually organized console outputs, making debugging and monitoring Node.js applications a more intuitive experience.
