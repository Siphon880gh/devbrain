### ✅ Let's say you have this code

```js
const exercisePath = path.join(__dirname, 'exercise');
// app.use(express.static(exercisePath)); // <- optional static serving

app.get('/exercise/:slug', (req, res) => {
 // Logic to lookup exercise in a database then present the HTML (Either through Handlebars or generate the HTML)
});
```

- You're defining a route handler for `/exercise/:slug`, which will run **custom logic** for each slug (e.g. query a database, render a template, etc.).
- You also have a commented-out line to serve static files from the `exercise/` directory.

---

### ❗If You Enable `app.use(express.static(...))`

**Potentially**, it may block reaching `app.get()` depending on file existence. This may be either intentional (creating prerendered files) or unintentional (forgetting your custom route is named the same as a path to a file).

#### ⚙️ What Happens If You Enable It?

If you uncomment this line:

```js
app.use(express.static(exercisePath));
```

And then have this file on disk:

```
exercise/running/index.html
```

When someone visits `/exercise/running`, Express will:

1. First check `express.static()` to see if `/exercise/running` maps to a file.
    - It does → it returns `index.html` without ever reaching your custom `.get()` route.

2. If no file exists, and **if no other middleware ends the request**, then `.get('/exercise/:slug')` would be tried.

#### 🔑 So which wins?

- If `express.static()` finds a matching file → it **handles** the request first.
- If not, then your `app.get()` route takes over.
- Middleware order matters: **whichever comes first in the file runs first**.

### 🧠 Solution: Custom route first, or choose one behavior

If you're dynamically rendering content, use only:

```js
app.get('/exercise/:slug', handler)
```

If you're serving **static HTML files**, use:

```js
app.use('/exercise', express.static(exercisePath));
```
