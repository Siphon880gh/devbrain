An Express server is basically a node process you leave running in the background so that the machine can act as a server that listens for requests and sends server responses, much like visiting a website or making API requests online. Then you can deploy this Express server on an online server that supports the node command, and the Experss server will work in the URL like:

https://www.yourwebsite.com:3001/api/etc

So refer to lesson on how to run node processes continuously at: Node -> Run on web server.
