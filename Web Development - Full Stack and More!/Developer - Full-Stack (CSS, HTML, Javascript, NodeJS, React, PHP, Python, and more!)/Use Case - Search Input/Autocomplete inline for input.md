You may notice on some websites, as you type, there's a **faded text inside the input box** (which auto-completes the rest of the user‚Äôs word / phrase / sentence). This feature often called **inline autocomplete**, **typeahead hinting**, or a **ghost suggestion**.

It works like this:

* As the user types, the best match is shown *within the input field*.
* The user sees their typed text in full color and the remaining suggested characters in a lighter gray.
* Pressing **Tab** or **Right Arrow** usually accepts the suggestion.

### üîç Does this work with the libraries mentioned?

| Library                       | Inline Autocomplete Support?       | Notes                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Downshift (React)**         | ‚úÖ Can implement manually           | Provides hooks to control rendering; you can overlay the hint using a second layer or value overlay technique |
| **React Autocomplete**        | ‚ùå Not built-in                     | Would need customization                                                                                      |
| **React Select**              | ‚ùå Not designed for inline behavior | Built for dropdowns, not inline hinting                                                                       |
| **jQuery UI Autocomplete**    | ‚ùå Not by default                   | Only dropdown-based                                                                                           |
| **Typeahead.js** (Bloodhound) | ‚úÖ Has inline "hinting" built-in    | Supports faded hint text using a separate input layer                                                         |

### üîß How Typeahead.js Does It

Typeahead.js supports this out of the box with:

```html
<input id="search" class="typeahead">
```

```javascript
$('#search').typeahead({
  hint: true,     // <-- This enables the faded text
  highlight: true,
  minLength: 1
}, {
  name: 'items',
  source: yourDataSource
});
```

CSS will automatically style the **hint** text lighter and inline. It uses a clever overlay of two input fields:

* One for the actual typed text
* One for showing the suggestion in gray

### üõ† In React: You Have to Build It

React-based libraries like Downshift let you recreate this behavior by:

* Keeping a "suggested value" alongside the input value
* Rendering both in the same input using controlled components and overlays
* Alternatively, layering a `div` with mirrored styles underneath a transparent input

There are community examples and custom hooks to help with this if needed.
