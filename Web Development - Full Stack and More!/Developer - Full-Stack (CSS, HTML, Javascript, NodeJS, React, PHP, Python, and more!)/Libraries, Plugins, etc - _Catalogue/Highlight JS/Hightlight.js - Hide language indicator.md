Recall thatÂ Hightlight.js creates a code snippet callout that lets user easily copy your code.

By default has language indicator. Here it's "CSS"

--> But you can hide the language indicator (especially if in the way of the code snippet on mobile)

Add this css to hide the language. Here it hides it on mobile only because it's a media query:
```
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  .code-badge-language {
    display: none;
  }
}
```
