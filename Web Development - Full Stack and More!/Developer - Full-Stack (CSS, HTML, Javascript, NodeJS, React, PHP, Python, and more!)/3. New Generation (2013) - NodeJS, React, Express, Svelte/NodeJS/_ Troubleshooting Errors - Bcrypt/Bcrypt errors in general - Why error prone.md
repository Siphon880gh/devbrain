Quick review: bcrypt is used often for converting plain passwords into hashed passwords before storing into the database for new user creations, and bcrypt often also used to compare the plain password against the retrieved hashed password during login

Problematic in many nodejs apps breaking installation or building but there are solution unique to each type of bcrypt error

Hereâ€™s why:
1. **OS-Specific Dependencies**: `bcrypt` often relies on native bindings, meaning it can behave differently depending on the OS, system libraries, or the way it's compiled. For example, some versions rely on `node-gyp`, which can cause installation issues across different environments.
2. **Different Implementations**: There are multiple implementations of `bcrypt`:
    - **bcrypt in C** (used in some Python and C++ libraries).
    - **bcrypt in JavaScript** (like `bcryptjs`, which is pure JS and slower but avoids native module issues).
    - **bcrypt in C++** (like `node.bcrypt` for Node.js, which is faster but requires compilation).
3. **Version and Compatibility Issues**: Different implementations sometimes produce different hashes or behave differently in edge cases. Also, older bcrypt implementations may have subtle security issues or limitations (e.g., some versions only support passwords up to 72 bytes).

### Alternative Solutions:

If you're working in an environment where bcrypt is causing issues, switching to a pure-JS implementation (`bcryptjs`). However, first you should refer to the help documents in this folder corresponding to your specific bcrypt error message or code.
