## Expression Evaluating into a Value

In React, curly braces `{}` are used within JSX to embed expressions into the markup. These expressions can evaluate to strings, numbers, JSX elements, or any other value that can be rendered in the UI. Here's a breakdown of how this works:

1. **Strings and Numbers**: When you put a JavaScript expression that evaluates to a string or a number within `{}`, React will render that value in the DOM. For example, `{ 'Hello, World!' }` will render the string "Hello, World!" in the UI.

2. **JSX Elements**: You can also embed JSX elements directly. This is useful for conditionally rendering components or for rendering components based on the results of a function or a loop. For example, `{ <MyComponent /> }` will render the `MyComponent` component.

3. **Conditional Rendering**: Curly braces are often used for conditional rendering. You can use JavaScript logical operators like `&&` or ternary operators inside `{}` to conditionally render elements. For example, `{isLoggedIn && <LogoutButton />}` will only render the `LogoutButton` component if `isLoggedIn` is true.

4. **Expressions**: Any valid JavaScript expression can be embedded inside `{}`, including function calls, calculations, access to object properties, etc. For example, `{ user.name }` would access the `name` property of the `user` object and render it.

5. **Components with Props**: When rendering components, you can use `{}` to dynamically assign props. For example, `<MyComponent message={message} />` would pass the `message` variable as a prop to `MyComponent`.

It's important to note that you cannot use statements inside `{}`, only expressions. This means you can't include if-else statements directly inside `{}`, but you can use ternary operators or the `&&` operator for conditional logic, and this is because the expression inside must be an expression that's evaluating  into a value.

## Expression can take inputs

The inputs could be other state variables or constants or javascript expression that calculates a value. The JSX will re-render if the state variables change.

## Expression Evaluating into an Array Value

Even though it must evaluate into a value, it could be rendered as an array value as well.

Yes, that's correct. The expression inside the curly braces `{}` in JSX must evaluate to a value, and this includes arrays. When you include an array inside `{}`, React will render the items in the array sequentially. Each item in the array is treated as a separate node or element.

Here are a few things to keep in mind when rendering arrays in JSX:

1. **Array of Primitive Values**: If the array contains primitive values (like strings or numbers), React will render them as a concatenated string. For example, `{[1, 2, 3]}` will render "123" on the screen.

2. **Array of JSX Elements**: If the array contains JSX elements, each element will be rendered in the order they appear in the array. For example, `{[<div>First</div>, <div>Second</div>]}` will render two `div` elements in sequence.

3. **Keys**: When rendering an array of elements, each element should have a unique "key" prop. The key helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. This is important for performance and can prevent bugs with element reordering.

4. **Expressions Inside Arrays**: You can also have expressions within the array, and as long as each expression evaluates to a valid JSX element or value, it will be rendered accordingly.

Here's a small example to illustrate rendering an array in JSX:

```jsx
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    // Key should be specified inside the array.
    <li key={number.toString()}>
      {number}
    </li>
  );
  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}

// Usage
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
ReactDOM.render(
  <NumberList numbers={numbers} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

In this example, an array of numbers is transformed into an array of `<li>` elements, each representing a number from the original array. The resulting array of JSX elements is then rendered inside a `<ul>` element.

## Naming

In the context of React and JSX, the curly braces `{}` are often referred to as "JSX curly braces" or simply "curly braces." They are a syntax extension provided by JSX that allows you to embed JavaScript expressions within the JSX code. While the term "curly braces" is quite general and used in various programming contexts to denote `{` and `}`, when discussed in the realm of JSX, it specifically refers to the mechanism for embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX. There isn't a more specific term than "JSX curly braces" or "curly braces in JSX" to describe this feature.

## Reworded:
What's possible:
JSX mixed with ternary operator and map, state setter as an Onclick attribute mixed with spread operator because you're partially changing a state's object value

JSX must evaluate:
JSX can return blank object, HTML, and string (can be blank string)
An array is allowed as long as its a permutation of the above resolutions
There is no concatenation operators
You can have consecutive curley bracket expressions
