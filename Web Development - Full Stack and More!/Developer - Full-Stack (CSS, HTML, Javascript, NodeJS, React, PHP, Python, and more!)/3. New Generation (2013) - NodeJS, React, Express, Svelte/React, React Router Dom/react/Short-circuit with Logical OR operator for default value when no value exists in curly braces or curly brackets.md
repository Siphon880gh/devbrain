Long titled: Short-circuit with Logical OR operator for default value when no value exists in curly braces or curly brackets

Certainly! Short-circuiting with the logical OR (`||`) operator is a concise way to handle scenarios where you want to display a default value if a variable has no value (aka is falsy). Here's an example demonstrating how to show the value of a string variable if it exists, or "Not found" if it's empty or falsy:

```jsx
const foundUsername = ""; // Example string variable

return (
  <div>
    <p>{foundUsername || "Not found"}</p>
  </div>
);
```

In this example:

- If `foundUsername` contains a non-empty string, that value will be rendered.
- If `foundUsername` is an empty string (`""`), null, undefined, or any other falsy value, "Not found" will be rendered instead.

This is a concise and common pattern for displaying default values in JSX based on the truthiness of a variable.
