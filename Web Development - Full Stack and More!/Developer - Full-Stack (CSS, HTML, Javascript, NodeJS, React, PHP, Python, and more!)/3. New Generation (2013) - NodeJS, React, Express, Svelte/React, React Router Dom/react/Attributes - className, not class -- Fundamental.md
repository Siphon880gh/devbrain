React forces me to use className. Why?


\<<
In React, the attribute `className` is used instead of `class` for defining CSS classes on elements. This is because `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript, and using it directly in JSX would cause a syntax error.

Since JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript, it needs to use slightly different attribute names to avoid conflicts with JavaScript keywords. The use of `className` instead of `class` is one such example.

Here's an example of how you should define CSS classes on elements in JSX:

```jsx
<div className="my-class">Content</div>
```

In this example, `className` is used instead of `class`. The actual CSS class name, "my-class" in this case, can be replaced with your desired class name.

By adhering to this naming convention, React ensures that the JSX code is correctly transpiled to JavaScript and avoids any potential conflicts with JavaScript keywords.

I apologize for the confusion. In the context of React, the `class` keyword is reserved for defining JavaScript classes. While it is not a direct conflict within JSX, using the `class` attribute instead of `className` in JSX could lead to potential issues if you also have JavaScript classes defined within the same component.

Consider the following example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  class = 'my-class'; // JavaScript class definition
  
  render() {
    return <div class={this.class}>Content</div>; // Incorrect usage of class attribute
  }
}
```

In this example, if you use the `class` attribute instead of `className` within the JSX code, it would conflict with the JavaScript `class` keyword used for class definitions. This would result in a syntax error and potentially unexpected behavior.

To avoid any confusion or conflicts, React encourages the use of `className` as the attribute name for defining CSS classes in JSX. By using `className`, you can differentiate it from JavaScript class definitions and ensure smooth integration with React components.
