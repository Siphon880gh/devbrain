In this article, we'll delve into how React Query refetches data when variables change, illustrated with two code snippets that show different ways of using the `useQuery` hook.

Background knowledge required: query string is a unique identifier for the query, which is used internally for caching and managing the query's state. So at `const { data: workoutRx, status, error } = useQuery("workoutQuery", fetchWorkout);`, "workoutQuery" is the query string.

### Understanding Query Keys

Query keys play a pivotal role in React Query's mechanism for tracking and caching queries. A query key is essentially an array or a string that uniquely identifies a query. When you use an array as a query key, React Query listens for changes in any element of this array and refetches the data if any change is detected.

### Query Key as Array

Consider the following snippet:

```javascript
const { data: workoutRx, status, error } = useQuery(["workoutQuery", day], fetchWorkout);
```

In this example, the query key is an array containing two elements: `"workoutQuery"` and `day`. The `day` variable represents a dynamic value that can change, for instance, based on user interaction or navigation. When `day` changes, React Query understands that the data associated with this key might be outdated and automatically triggers a refetch.

This behavior is particularly useful when your data fetch needs to respond to changes in variables like user IDs, filter settings, or pagination information.

### Query Key as Strings

Now, let's examine a scenario where the query key is a simple string:

```javascript
const { data: workoutRx, status, error } = useQuery("workoutQuery", fetchWorkout);
```

Here, the query key is just `"workoutQuery"`, a static string. With this setup, React Query does not automatically refetch the data when external variables change because it has no way of knowing that the data should be dependent on any external parameters. The data is refetched only under standard scenarios like window refocus or network reconnection unless manually triggered.

This approach is suitable when the data you're fetching does not depend on dynamic variables or when you want full control over the refetching behavior.

### Choosing the Right Approach

The choice between using an array or a string as a query key depends on your specific use case:

- Use an array with dynamic variables when your data fetch needs to react automatically to changes in those variables.
- Use a simple string when your data fetch is independent of external parameters or when you prefer to control refetching manually.

Understanding these nuances allows you to harness the full power of React Query, making your applications more responsive and efficient.

### Conclusion

React Query's flexibility with query keys offers developers a powerful tool to manage data fetching and caching based on changing variables. By judiciously choosing between string or array-based query keys, developers can fine-tune how their applications respond to data dependencies, ensuring users always have the most relevant and up-to-date information at their fingertips.
