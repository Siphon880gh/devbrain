To install React Query in your React project, you can use either npm or yarn. For NPM, you run: `npm install react-query`

With the React Query library, there is a component called `QueryClientProvider`. This component is used to provide a `QueryClient` instance to your React application, allowing you to use React Query's features for fetching, caching, and updating asynchronous data in your application as long as your components are descendants of QueryClientProvider.

Here's a basic overview of how you would use `QueryClientProvider` in a React application:

1. **Importing `QueryClient` and `QueryClientProvider`:** First, you need to import these from the `react-query` library.

   ```javascript
   import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from 'react-query';
   ```

2. **Creating a `QueryClient` Instance:** Before you can use the `QueryClientProvider`, you need to create an instance of `QueryClient`. This instance is used to configure settings and defaults for your queries and mutations.

   ```javascript
   const queryClient = new QueryClient();
   ```

3. **Wrapping Your Application with `QueryClientProvider`:** You wrap your application's component tree with `QueryClientProvider` and pass the `queryClient` instance as a prop. This makes the React Query features accessible throughout your component tree.

   ```jsx
   function App() {
     return (
       <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
         {/* The rest of your application */}
       </QueryClientProvider>
     );
   }
   ```

By wrapping your app with `QueryClientProvider`, you're effectively enabling your components to use React Query's `useQuery`, `useMutation`, and other hooks that require React Query's context to function. This setup is crucial for enabling data fetching and synchronization across your React application using React Query.
