You'd deploy it to github pages but it's not as easy as with a simple static webpage where you just needed an index.html at root. It will involve package.json and a gh-page branchs

To deploy a React application to GitHub Pages, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Git installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from the official website: https://git-scm.com/

2. Create a new repository on GitHub. Make note of the repository URL.

3. In your React project's root directory, open a terminal or command prompt.

4. Install the `gh-pages` package as a development dependency by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install gh-pages --save-dev
   ```

5. Once the installation is complete, open the `package.json` file in your project.

6. Add the following lines to the top-level of the `package.json` file:

   ```json
   "homepage": "https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name",
   ```

   Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `your-repository-name` with the name of your repository.

7. In the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file, add the following two scripts:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "predeploy": "npm run build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
   }
   ```

8. Save the `package.json` file.

9. Build your React application by running the following command:

```shell
npm run build
```

or

```
npm run predeploy
```


The reason why we have a predeploy script is because it's good practice. The developer can run predeploy which usually includes server specific building too, then run deploy

10. Once the build process is complete, deploy your application to GitHub Pages by running the following command:

    ```shell
    npm run deploy
    ```

11. Wait for the deployment to finish. It may take a few moments.

12. Once the deployment is complete, you can access your React application at the URL specified in the `homepage` field of your `package.json` file.

That's it! Your React application should now be successfully deployed to GitHub Pages.
