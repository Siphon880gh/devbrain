This makes it possible to not have to do short circuiting

## Approach A - IIFE Inside JSX

You can use Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) inside JSX curly brackets to perform conditional rendering with if-else statements. Here's an example:

```javascript
return (
  <div>
    {
      (() => {
        if (condition1) {
          return <p>Condition 1 is true</p>;
        } else if (condition2) {
          return <p>Condition 2 is true</p>;
        } else {
          return <p>Neither condition is true</p>;
        }
      })()
    }
  </div>
);
```

In this example:

- We use an IIFE inside the curly brackets `{}` to immediately execute a function.
- Inside the function, we have if-else statements to conditionally render JSX based on different conditions.
- Depending on the conditions, we return different JSX elements.
- The result of the IIFE (which is JSX) is rendered within the `<div>` element.

This allows you to achieve full if-else, else-if-else logic within JSX curly brackets.

## Approach B - Named Function Call Inside JSX

You can define a separate function outside the JSX return statement and then call that function within the curly brackets. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
// Define a separate function for conditional rendering
function renderContent(condition) {
  if (condition) {
    return <p>Condition is true</p>;
  } else {
    return <p>Condition is false</p>;
  }
}

// Inside your component's render method
return (
  <div>
    {renderContent(condition)}
  </div>
);
```

In this simplified version:

- We define a separate function `renderContent` outside the JSX return statement.
- Inside this function, we have a simple if-else statement for conditional rendering based on a single condition.
- We call this function within the JSX curly brackets `{}` and pass the condition as an argument.
- The result of the `renderContent` function call is rendered within the `<div>` element.

This approach maintains clarity by separating the logic for conditional rendering from the JSX return statement, promoting cleaner and more readable code.
