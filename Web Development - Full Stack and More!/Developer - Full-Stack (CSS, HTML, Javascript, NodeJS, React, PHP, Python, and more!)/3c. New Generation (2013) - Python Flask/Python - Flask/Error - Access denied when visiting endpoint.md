TLDR:


```
     if __name__ == "__main__":
         app.run(debug=True, port=5001)  # Change to a port that is free
```


Close out MAMP

An "access denied" error when trying to access your Flask application running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` can occur due to several reasons. Here are a few common ones and how you might resolve them:

1. **Server Not Running:**
   - Ensure that your Flask server is running. You should start it by executing the script that contains your Flask application.
   - If the server has started successfully, you'll see output in the console indicating that it's running, typically with a line like `* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)`.

2. **Firewall Restrictions:**
   - Your firewall might be blocking the request. Check your firewall settings to ensure that it's not preventing access to that port.

3. **Port Already in Use:**
   - The port you are trying to use (5000) may already be in use by another application. You can change the port Flask runs on by modifying the `app.run` call to include a different port:
     ```python
     if __name__ == "__main__":
         app.run(debug=True, port=5001)  # Change to a port that is free
     ```

4. **Incorrect URL:**
   - Make sure you have not made any typos in the URL. `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` is the default for Flask, but if you have set a different port or path in your app configuration, you will need to use that instead.

5. **Permissions Issues:**
   - Ensure that your user account has the necessary permissions to open the port and bind the application to it.

6. **Application Error:**
   - If there's an error in your Flask application code, it might prevent the server from starting properly. Check the terminal or command prompt for Python errors.
   - If you're using `debug=True`, Flask will show an interactive debugger in the browser for most errors, which can help diagnose the issue.

7. **Database Connection Issue:**
   - If the "access denied" message is coming from a database connection attempt (MySQL in your case), it could mean that your Flask application doesn't have the correct credentials, the MySQL server is not running, or the user does not have permission to access the database.

8. **Running as a non-root user:**
   - If you are on a Unix-based system and trying to bind your server to port 80 or any port below 1024, you will need root privileges. Consider using a port higher than 1024 to avoid this issue.

9. **Browser Cache:**
   - Sometimes the browser might show an old cached error page. Try clearing your browser cache or try accessing the page using a different browser or incognito mode.
