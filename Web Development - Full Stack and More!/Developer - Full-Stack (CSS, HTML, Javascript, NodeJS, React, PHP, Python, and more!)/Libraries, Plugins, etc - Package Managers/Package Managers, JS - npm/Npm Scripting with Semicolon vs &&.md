The two commands perform similar tasks, but there is a crucial difference in how they handle errors.

1. `cd client; npm start;`

This command uses a semicolon to separate the two commands `cd client` and `npm start`. This means that regardless of whether the first command (cd client) is successful or not, the second command (npm start) will be executed.

2. `cd client && npm start`

This command uses `&&` to separate the two commands. The `&&` is a logical 'and' operator. In the context of executing shell commands, this means that the second command will only be executed if the first command is successful. So if for some reason `cd client` fails (maybe because the directory doesn't exist), `npm start` will not be executed.

In most cases, you'd probably want to use `cd client && npm start`, to avoid attempting to start the application if the change directory command fails. It's safer because it ensures that the directory change has happened before it tries to execute `npm start`.
