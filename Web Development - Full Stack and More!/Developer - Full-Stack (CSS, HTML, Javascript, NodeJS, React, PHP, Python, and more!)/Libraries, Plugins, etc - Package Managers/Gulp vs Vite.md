Some legacy apps were developed with Gulp because that was before modern build tools like Vite became popular. Gulp is used to:

- Define custom build pipelines
- Transpile TypeScript files
- Copy static assets
- Run Webpack for bundling frontend code
- Watch files during development for live updates

You might associate Vite with React. This sounds like Vibe can be used without React because Gulp isn't necessarily used with React. Absolutely. Vite is framework-agnostic â€” it works seamlessly with plain JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, Preact, Svelte, and many other setups. Recall that when you run `npm create vite app`, you get a menu to choose from Vanilla, Vue, React, Preact... Others.
