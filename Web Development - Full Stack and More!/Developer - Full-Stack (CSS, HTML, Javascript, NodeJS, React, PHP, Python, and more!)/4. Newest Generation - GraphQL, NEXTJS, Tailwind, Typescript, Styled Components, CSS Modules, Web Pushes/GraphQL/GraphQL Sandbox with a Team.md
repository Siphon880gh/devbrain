## Sharing Typedefs

/server/schema/TypeSchema can be shared with others on your team and they'll know how to query your app's server or implement the frontend queries/mutations

## Remote GraphQL Playground

#### Configuring GraphQL Playground with a Remote URL

When you open GraphQL Playground in your browser, it typically connects to the local server instance from which it was served. However, you can easily change this to point to a remote GraphQL server:

1. **Open GraphQL Playground**: Navigate to the GraphQL Playground interface in your browser. If you're using a local instance, it might be something like `http://localhost:4000/graphql`.
    
2. **Change the Endpoint**: In the GraphQL Playground interface, you'll see a URL at the center top of the page. This is the endpoint URL that Playground is currently set to interact with. By default, this might be set to the local server's endpoint.
    
3. **Set to Remote URL**: You can change this URL to your remote GraphQL server's endpoint. For example, if your remote GraphQL server is available at `https://example-graphql-server.com/graphql`, you would replace the default or current endpoint URL with this one.
    
4. **Reload Playground**: After changing the endpoint, you might need to reload the page to ensure the new endpoint is active.
    
5. **Query the Remote Server**: Now, you can write and execute queries and mutations against the remote server directly from your local GraphQL Playground.
    

#### Sharing Remote Endpoints

When working in a team, if you wish to share the configured Playground with a remote endpoint, you can:

1. **Share the URL**: Directly share the Playground URL with the changed endpoint with your team members. They can open it in their browsers and will be able to interact with the same remote server.
    
2. **Export and Share Configuration**: Some versions of GraphQL Playground allow you to export your settings and queries. You can export these and share them with your team members, who can then import them into their Playground instances.
    

#### Considerations for Remote URLs

- **Authentication**: If your remote GraphQL server requires authentication, make sure to include the necessary authentication tokens or credentials when making requests from GraphQL Playground.
    
- **CORS**: Ensure that your remote GraphQL server is configured to accept requests from the origin where your GraphQL Playground is hosted, as cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policies might block requests from unknown origins.
    
- **Environment Variables**: If you are using environment variables to store remote URLs or other sensitive information, ensure they are securely managed and accessible where needed.
    

By setting up GraphQL Playground to interact with a remote server, teams can collaborate more effectively, sharing and testing queries and mutations in a real-world environment.
