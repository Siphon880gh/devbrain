The server's typeDefs.js file at the root fields are one of these four items:
- Query: Defines the entry points for 'read' operations in the schema, allowing clients to fetch data.
- Mutation: Specifies the entry points for 'write' operations, enabling clients to modify data (create, update, delete).
- Response Types: These are the types that define the structure and type of data that can be returned from a query or mutation.
- Input Types: These are the types that you define in GraphQL to specify the shape and type of data that can be sent to the server.

For example, a video library with user accounts:
```
// typeDefs.js
const typeDefs = `
  type User {
    _id: ID!
    username: String!
    email: String
    videoCount: Int
    savedVideos: [Video]
  }

  type Video {
    videoId: ID!
    authors: [String]
    description: String
    image: String
    link: String
    title: String!
  }

  type Auth {
    token: ID!
    user: User
  }

  input VideoInput {
    authors: [String]
    description: String!
    videoId: String!
    image: String
    link: String
    title: String!
  }

  type Query {
    me: User
  }

  type Mutation {
    login(email: String!, password: String!): Auth
    addUser(username: String!, email: String!, password: String!): Auth
    saveVideo(videoData: VideoInput!): User
    removeVideo(videoId: ID!): User
  }
`;

module.exports = typeDefs;
```
