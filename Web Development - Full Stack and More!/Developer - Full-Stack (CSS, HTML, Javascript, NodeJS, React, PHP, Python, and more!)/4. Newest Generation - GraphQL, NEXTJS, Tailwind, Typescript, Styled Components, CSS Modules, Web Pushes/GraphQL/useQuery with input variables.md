- Apollo's useQuery could be passed inputs (for example, finding a specific user by their ID)
- useQuery is designed to react to changes in its inputs. When it detects a change, it triggers a new fetch to ensure the data in the component is updated accordingly.

Let's assume `GET_ITEMS_QUERY` is a GraphQL query that fetches items of a particular type, returning an array of items. Then we render a list of items. 

We'll show how `MyComponent` could use the `loading`, `error`, and `data` states to handle different scenarios:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useQuery, gql } from '@apollo/client';

// Define the GraphQL query
const GET_ITEMS_QUERY = gql`
  query GetItems($type: String!) {
    items(type: $type) {
      id
      name
      description
    }
  }
`;

function MyComponent({ itemType }) {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_ITEMS_QUERY, {
    variables: { type: itemType },
  });

  // Show a loading message while the query is in progress
  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;

  // Show an error message if the query failed
  if (error) return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;

  // Render the data once it's available
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Items of type: {itemType}</h2>
      <ul>
        {data.items.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.id}>
            <h3>{item.name}</h3>
            <p>{item.description}</p>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Explanation of the Expanded Example:

1. **GraphQL Query**: `GET_ITEMS_QUERY` is defined using the `gql` template literal tag provided by Apollo Client. This query expects a variable `type` and fetches items of that type, each with an `id`, `name`, and `description`.

2. **useQuery Hook**: The component calls `useQuery`, passing in the query and variables. The `variables` object includes `type`, which is set to the `itemType` prop, allowing the query to fetch items based on the provided type.

3. **Loading State**: If the query is still loading, the component renders a paragraph element displaying "Loading...". This provides immediate feedback to the user that data is being fetched.

4. **Error State**: If the query encounters an error, the component renders a paragraph element displaying the error message. This helps in debugging and informing the user that something went wrong.

5. **Successful Data Fetching**: Once the data is successfully fetched, the component renders a list of items. It maps over `data.items`, creating a list item for each one with its name and description.
   
6. **Refetches**: If the variables passed to the `useQuery` hook change, it will automatically rerun the query with the new variables, then the webpage will reflect the response.

This component dynamically responds to the state of the GraphQL query, providing a robust user experience by handling loading states, errors, and successful data fetching.
