Styled-components leverage a concept called "tagged template literals" in JavaScript. When you define a styled component using the `styled` function provided by styled-components, you're essentially creating a function that parses template literals (the backtick-delimited strings) and transforms them into React components.

Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Tagged template literals**: When you define a styled component like this:

   ```javascript
   const Button = styled.button`
       background-color: #007bff;
       color: white;
       font-size: 16px;
       padding: 10px 20px;
       border: none;
       border-radius: 4px;
       cursor: pointer;

       &:hover {
           background-color: #0056b3;
       }
   `;
   ```

   The template literal (the string enclosed in backticks) is passed to the `styled` function as an argument.

2. **Parsing and transformation**: The `styled` function parses the template literal and identifies any CSS-like syntax within it. It then dynamically generates a React component based on this CSS.

3. **Returning a React component**: The `styled` function returns a React component that encapsulates the specified styles. This component can then be used just like any other React component within your application.

4. **Dynamic styling**: Styled-components also allow for dynamic styling through the use of JavaScript expressions within the template literals. This allows you to create reusable components with dynamic styles based on props or other variables.

So, in essence, you're correct. The `styled` function works with template literals to rewrite them into JSX, effectively creating React components with the specified styles. This approach offers a more intuitive and convenient way to manage styles in React applications.
