If you followed the Edit Invoice in [[12a. Zod, Server Actions, Mutation (Create, Update, Delete to Database)]] which was said to be optional, then you can skip to getStaticParams section, because you would have learned how to get the parameter from the dynamic route url already.

Create file
`app/help/issue/[category]/[issue]/page.tsx`:
```
export default async function Page({ params }: { params: Promise<{ category:string, issue: string }> }) {
	const {category, issue} = await params;
	
    function convertToTitleCase(stringVal:string) {
        return stringVal?.split('-').map(word => word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1)).join('')
    }

    return (
        <div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center text-center justify-center">
            Your {convertToTitleCase(category)} help ticket #{issue} has been submitted. 
            <br/><br/>
            Thank you.
        </div>
    )
}
```

^ Note for dynamic routes we have to make the function async, we get the params using await, and we validate the params as a Promise. This is due to the way NextJS processes Server Actions or API Routes that allows for streaming. Yes, a component can use useSearchParams and it would technically not have to do Promises, however, that would mean having to render at the client side instead of server sided rendering, which will cause a performance hit.
^ Note if you do not code async for the function, await for the params retrieval, and Promise for the params validation, `npm run dev` will work, but it will fail at `npx next build` or Vercel deployment which runs the build script, erroring about PageProps constraint not being satisfied and suggesting `Promise<any>`
^ Note if you were following the official docs to create edit invoice which uses the [id] part of the dynamic route url, it will initially not have async/await/promise but at a later step have you add them, in case you weren't following due diligence with reading every step.

Then visit `localhost:3000/help/issue/Bug/100`

You'll get a page like this:
![[Pasted image 20250308223512.png]]

Note that:
- Button from bottom left is from `app/layout.tsx` which bundles page.tsx at nested levels (unless another `layout.tsx` found)
- The URL ends in `/Bug/100` which corresponds to the folders `[category]/[issue]`
- The `category` and the `issue` are URL parameters (Not the same as URL search parameters). The URL parameters are key names in the definition (In NextJS case, when you rename folders), and their values are in the URL at the corresponding forward-slash position in the path name.
- So category is "Bug" and issue is "100" which fills in the JSX at:
```
Your {convertToTitleCase(params.category)} help ticket #{params.issue} has been submitted. 
```

Implications:
- URLs can be really customized to the user and the page that opens will be consistent to the custom information.
- The information can be used to create/read/update/delete from the database.
	- Eg. If a url is defined by folders as `/profile/[profileId]`, and the user visited `/profile/100` on a social media website, then a database query to `SELECT * from WHERE profile = 100` is ran and that profile's information like username, friends, etc may be returned and the component could render a proper profile page.

## getStaticParams


Let’s say you have a product route that people can see products by visiting `localhost:3000/product/[id]` . Let’s say you know that product #1 will rarely change. You can build it statically at build time and serve that at the dynamic route `/products/1` while all other products (`/products/2`, `/products/3` ,etc) can get a fresh copy at run time (rather than load a statically built cache copy).

You'd export an async function called generateStaticParams that returns an array of params (the defined square bracket folder name) to keys (the url parameter value)

Create `app/products/[id]/page.tsx`:
- You are providing finished route(s) to cache at build time (because the id fills in the dynamic route `products/[id]` to `products/1`.
```
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  return [{ id: '1' }];
}

export default async function Page({params}: { params: Promise<{id: string}> }) {
  const {id} = await params;
  return (
      <div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center text-center justify-center">
          Product id {id} shown.
      </div>
  )
}
```

Note if you visit the web browser at `localhost:3000/products/1` from `npm run build`, it will not pull from the static build time cache. It's for production code.

Let's test production. Run `npx run build`.

The cache copy would be created at `/.next/server/app/products/1.html`
![[Pasted image 20250309002333.png]]

Then run `npx run start`, and visit the web browser at `localhost:3000/products/1`. It loads instantly, but you can't really tell if it's from a cache copy just from seeing that.

Go to network inspection shows that the resource 1 would be delivered with **304 Not Modified.** The HTTP status code 304 Not Modified means the server has determined that the requested page hasn't changed since your last visit. Instead of downloading the same content again, your browser loads the cached version stored locally, reducing unnecessary data transfer.
![[Pasted image 20250309002324.png]]

That confirms that product at id=1 is static built and cached for production code. All other product id's will be fresh copies pulled in at run time.

If you want to cache more at build time:
```
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  return [{ id: '1' }, { id: '2' }, { id: '3' }];
}
```
You are providing finished routes to cache at build time (because the id fills in the dynamic route `products/[id]` to `products/1`, `products/2`, and `products/3`.
