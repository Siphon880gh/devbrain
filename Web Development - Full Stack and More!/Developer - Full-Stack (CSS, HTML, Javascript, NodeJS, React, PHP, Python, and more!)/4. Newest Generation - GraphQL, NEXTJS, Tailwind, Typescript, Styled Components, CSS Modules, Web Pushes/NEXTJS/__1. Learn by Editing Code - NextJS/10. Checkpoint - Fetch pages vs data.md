We’ve been working on Fetch to retrieve pages. As you know from general web development, fetch can retrieve pages or data in the form of json, for most use cases. In NextJS, instead of using fetch to retrieve json data, because NextJS components can be server components, we retrieved data from the database Postgres directly and rendering it directly all within the components (no need for an intermediate json or fetching to and receiving at url endpoints). 

(As a consequence, a NextJS project that has server parts like accessing database - when deployed - will run continuously at a port. If you only have static content, then you can export a static HTML-CSS-Page with `next export` command)

If we were to develop an API that serves json data to other developers, we would be using ExpressJS rather than NextJS.

Since we’ve been using Fetch for navigation purposes (retrieving pages), we’ll continue on navigation topics. Next is search and pagination leveraging Postgres query to offset row results and limit row results returned
