### Setup for fetching cards

The official documentation requires you to make code changes and experience the results firsthand. It also walks you through multiple data retrieval implementations, letting you experience the lag before introducing better alternatives. Instead, we'll take a more structured approach with previews to clearly illustrate our goals, and we'll provide a comprehensive comparison of all data retrieval methods, outlining their pros and cons.

We will have `dashboard/page.tsx` show three cards:
![[Pasted image 20250308034516.png]]

At `/app/dashboard/page.tsx`  we will import the cards:
```
import CardWrapper from '@/app/ui/dashboard/card-wrapper';  
import RevenueChart from '@/app/ui/dashboard/revenue-chart';  
import LatestInvoices from '@/app/ui/dashboard/latest-invoices';  
import { lusitana } from '@/app/ui/fonts';  
  
export default async function Page() {  
    return (  
        <main>  
            <h1 className={`${lusitana.className} mb-4 text-xl md:text-2xl`}>  
                Dashboard  
            </h1>  
            <div className="grid gap-6 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4">  
                <CardWrapper />  
            </div>  
            <div className="mt-6 grid grid-cols-1 gap-6 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-8">  
                <RevenueChart />  
                <LatestInvoices />  
            </div>  
        </main>  
    );  
}
```

One of the cards need to be implemented. Create `/app/ui/dashboard/card-wrapper.tsx` :
```
import { Card } from '@/app/ui/dashboard/cards';  
import {  
    fetchCardData,  
} from '@/app/lib/data';  
  
export default async function CardWrapper() {  
    const {  
        numberOfInvoices,  
        numberOfCustomers,  
        totalPaidInvoices,  
        totalPendingInvoices,  
    } = await fetchCardData(); // wait for fetchLatestInvoices() to finish  
  
  return (  
    <>  
        <Card title="Collected" value={totalPaidInvoices} type="collected" />  
        <Card title="Pending" value={totalPendingInvoices} type="pending" />  
        <Card title="Total Invoices" value={numberOfInvoices} type="invoices" />  
        <Card  
          title="Total Customers"  
          value={numberOfCustomers}  
          type="customers"  
        />  
    </>  
  );  
}
```


The other two cards have implementation code that’s been commented out, making the cards appear unfinished.
- At `app/ui/dashboard/latest-invoices.tsx`  card implementation, uncomment all production code.
- At `app/ui/dashboard/revenue-chart.tsx`  card implementation, uncomment all production code.

We also need to add fetching (Cardwrapper is taken care of):
- At `app/ui/dashboard/latest-invoices.tsx` , change the function signature and add fetch code:
```
import { fetchLatestInvoices } from '@/app/lib/data';  
// ...  
export default async function LatestInvoices() {  
  const latestInvoices = await fetchLatestInvoices();
```

- At `app/ui/dashboard/revenue-chart.tsx` , change the function signature and add fetch code:
```
import { fetchRevenue } from '@/app/lib/data';  
// ...  
export default async function RevenueChart() {  
  const revenue = await fetchRevenue();
```

Let’s look into fetchRevenue, fetchLatestInvoices, and fetchCardData at app/lib/data.ts . You’ll see they query the postgreSQL database directly. This is because with NextJS, you can have Server components. This is more streamlined than the older React/Vite/CRA which requires useEffect and useState to wait for the fetching at an Express api endpoint (for example), and then display a loading sprite before rendering the data on the webpage (useState that’s initially loading=true, then loading=false when the fetch completes). NextJS actually makes the fetches as part of the build process, then bakes in the results into the JS (in other words, it caches the responses at build time). This is definitely a problem if you expect the data to change - we’ll cover how to make the fetches only happen during run time at a later section.


We will cover different fetching coding patterns. 

### Fetch Pattern: Fetch one after another

We have three different fetch functions, fetchRevenue, fetchLatestInvoices, and fetchCardData. They fetch one after another waiting for the previous fetch because of await . If on a slow computer, it would be like this (slowed down to demonstrate):

![animation](NextJS-EditCode-1.gif)

The downside is a horrible user experience waiting for each card to hold, and some anxiety if it finished loading all cards. Here it’s one second a card, but on a slow connection, it’ll be several seconds a card. The cards appear to pop into place which can also be gnarring, and it can also cause cumulative layout shifts if content pushes to the next row on the next render.

### Fetch Pattern: Fetch all in parallel

In JavaScript, you can use `Promise.all()` to run multiple promises concurrently, but if any promise fails, the entire operation fails. Alternatively, `Promise.allSettled()` executes all promises and returns their results, regardless of whether they succeed or fail.

You don’t have to follow these coding instructions because it would be a lot of undoing after this section is done. You would’ve moved all the fetch outside the cards and into dashboard page.tsx and query the database at dashboard page.tsx rather than card component → `dashboard/lib/data.tsx`  querying the database

But if you do choose to follow along, make a commit first. Then I’ll instruct you to undo the changes to the commit with a `git stash`  later.

dashboard/page.tsx:
```
import CardWrapper from '@/app/ui/dashboard/card-wrapper';  
import RevenueChart from '@/app/ui/dashboard/revenue-chart';  
import LatestInvoices from '@/app/ui/dashboard/latest-invoices';  
import { lusitana } from '@/app/ui/fonts';  
import {  
    InvoiceForm,  
    Revenue,  
    LatestInvoiceRaw,  
} from '@/app/lib/definitions';  
import postgres from 'postgres';  
  
export default async function Page() {  
    const sql = postgres(process.env.POSTGRES_URL!, { ssl: 'require' });  
  
    const invoiceCountsPromise = sql`SELECT   
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices) AS invoice_count,  
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers) AS customer_count,  
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'paid' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS paid,  
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'pending' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS pending  
FROM invoices;  
`;  
    const revenuePromise = sql<Revenue[]>`SELECT * FROM revenue`;  
    const latestInvoicesPromise = sql<LatestInvoiceRaw[]>`SELECT invoices.amount, customers.name, customers.image_url, customers.email, invoices.id  
      FROM invoices  
      JOIN customers ON invoices.customer_id = customers.id  
      ORDER BY invoices.date DESC  
      LIMIT 5`;  
  
  
    // Wait for all promises to resolve and extract the required values from the query results  
    const [invoiceCountsResult, revenueResult, latestInvoicesResult] = await Promise.all([  
        invoiceCountsPromise,  
        revenuePromise,  
        latestInvoicesPromise,  
        // await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)) // Uncomment if want to slow down the loading more to see loading sprite  
    ]);  
  
    // Extract the counts from invoice counts result  
    const {  
        invoice_count: numberOfInvoices,  
        customer_count: numberOfCustomers,  
        paid: totalPaidInvoices,  
        pending: totalPendingInvoices  
    } = invoiceCountsResult?.[0];  
      
    const revenue = revenueResult;  
    const latestInvoices = latestInvoicesResult.map((invoice) => ({  
        id: invoice.id,  
        name: invoice.name,  
        image_url: invoice.image_url,  
        email: invoice.email,  
        amount: invoice.amount.toString()  
    }));  
  
    return (  
        <main>  
            <h1 className={`${lusitana.className} mb-4 text-xl md:text-2xl`}>  
                Dashboard  
            </h1>  
            <div className="grid gap-6 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4">  
                <CardWrapper numberOfInvoices={numberOfInvoices} numberOfCustomers={numberOfCustomers} totalPaidInvoices={totalPaidInvoices} totalPendingInvoices={totalPendingInvoices}  
                />  
            </div>  
            <div className="mt-6 grid grid-cols-1 gap-6 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-8">  
                <RevenueChart revenue={revenue} />  
                <LatestInvoices latestInvoices={latestInvoices} />  
            </div>  
        </main>  
    );  
}
```


^ Promise.all can receive fetch("...")  as well

Each card would receive the prop (and you’re forced to define the type of the prop because of Typescript) and you would comment out the previous fetch function call

ui/dashboard/card-wrapper.tsx:
```
export default async function CardWrapper({  
  numberOfInvoices,  
  numberOfCustomers,  
  totalPaidInvoices,  
  totalPendingInvoices  
}: {  
  numberOfInvoices: number;  
  numberOfCustomers: number;  
  totalPaidInvoices: number;  
  totalPendingInvoices: number;  
}) {  
    // const {  
    //     numberOfInvoices,  
    //     numberOfCustomers,  
    //     totalPaidInvoices,  
    //     totalPendingInvoices,  
    // } = await fetchCardData(); // wait for fetchLatestInvoices() to finish
```

  
ui/dashboard/latest-invoices.tsx:
```
export default async function LatestInvoices({  
latestInvoices  
}: {  
  latestInvoices: LatestInvoice[];  
}) {  
  // const latestInvoices = await fetchLatestInvoices();
```

ui/dashboard/revenue-chart.tsx:
```
export default async function RevenueChart({revenue}:{revenue:Revenue[]}) {  
  // const revenue = await fetchRevenue();
```


So all three fetches will be performed in parallel. When the fetched data shows up is all at the same time. It’ll only take as long as the slowest fetch. So this causes an awkward white screen until all fetches are ready. If on a slow computer, it would be like this (slowed down to demonstrate):

![animation](NextJS-EditCode-2.gif)

If you had followed along, you may want to enter command `git stash` now in order to revert back to the code before we butchered each card’s component implementation for the sake of showing Promise.all or Promise.allSettled


### Fetch Pattern: Stream page

Leverage NextJS’ “Streaming” (NextJS” vocab for showing a loading sprite in place of content until the content is ready, the word streaming eluding to information streaming in while the rest of the page finished loading) by adding a `loading.tsx`  to the same folder `dashboard/`:
```
export default function Loading() {  
  return (  
    <div>  
        Loading...  
    </div>  
  );  
}
```

So when you visit that path’s route, a loading page can appear until the fetch is ready to replace the loading page with the actual fetched content:

#### - UX: Stream page with word "Loading"

![animation](NextJS-EditCode-3.gif)

#### - UX: Stream page with spinner

You can make the word Loading more exciting by adding a rotating progress circle:
```
export default function Loading() {  
  return (  
    <div>  
        <svg className="mr-3 -ml-1 size-5 animate-spin inline text-black" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><circle className="opacity-25" cx="12" cy="12" r="10" stroke="currentColor" strokeWidth="4"></circle><path className="opacity-75" fill="currentColor" d="M4 12a8 8 0 018-8V0C5.373 0 0 5.373 0 12h4zm2 5.291A7.962 7.962 0 014 12H0c0 3.042 1.135 5.824 3 7.938l3-2.647z"></path></svg>  
        Loading...  
    </div>  
  );  
}
```


![animation](NextJS-EditCode-4.gif)

If the rotating animation is not playing, please refer to [[NextJS UX - Loading Spinner or Animate Spinning]]
#### - UX: Stream page with layout skeleton

![animation](NextJS-EditCode-5.gif)

Instead of streaming with the word “Loading” or spinner before the rest of the fetched content renders, you can show a skeleton of the layout, hinting that it's about to be filled in with content. It’s a more modern trend with loading sprites.  

Adjust `loading.tsx`   the same folder `dashboard/`:
```
import DashboardSkeleton from "@/app/ui/skeletons";  
  
export default function Loading() {  
  return (  
    <DashboardSkeleton/>  
  );  
}
```

  
####  ⚠️ Caveat of streaming page with layout.tsx  ⚠️
Side effect of adding loading.tsx: loading.tsx, like layout.tsx, will go recursively down the nested folders, so if you have any pages in nested folder from dashboard/, they will use the same loading.tsx unless you have another loading.tsx at that level. You can limit the loading.tsx from affecting deeper levels by adding a group:

![[Pasted image 20250308035611.png]]
  
^grouping won’t affect URLs, so localhost:3000/dashboard still loads `dashboard/(overview)/page.tsx` . You can use grouping for organization purposes too.

### Fetch Pattern: Stream at component level
Regarding streaming the entire page, there is one major flaw. If one of the promises take a long time to load, the entire page will be in the loading phase for a long time. It may be better to have the streaming occur at a card to card level, that way, user sees in position where the information will load, there is no waiting for all of them to load at one time, and there is no popping or sudden layout changes - none of the disadvantages of the above approaches. In addition, the user can start reading information right away for the. card(s) that have loaded, and further cards that load won’t affect the layout.

NextJS looked for loading.tsx to stream the entire page. In lieu of it, you can use Suspense component, then you can finetune loading to the component level. Here is how it looks (notice I slowed down the loading for demo purposes):

![animation](NextJS-EditCode-6.gif)

Here's how to stream at a component basis:

1.  Import Suspense
```
import { Suspense } from 'react';
```

2. At the component that have promises/fetches/database query tied to them, wrap around with Suspense provider, and give the Suspense provider a fallback component (the loading sprite):
```
import {CardsSkeleton, RevenueChartSkeleton, LatestInvoicesSkeleton} from '../ui/skeletons';  
// ...  
  
            <div className="grid gap-6 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4">  
                <Suspense fallback={<CardsSkeleton />}>  
                    <CardWrapper />  
                </Suspense>  
            </div>  
            <div className="mt-6 grid grid-cols-1 gap-6 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-8">  
                <Suspense fallback={<RevenueChartSkeleton />}>  
                    <RevenueChart />  
                </Suspense>  
                <Suspense fallback={<LatestInvoicesSkeleton />}>  
                    <LatestInvoices />  
                </Suspense>  
            </div>
```

Your dashboard page.tsx could look like:
```
import CardWrapper from '@/app/ui/dashboard/card-wrapper';  
import RevenueChart from '@/app/ui/dashboard/revenue-chart';  
import LatestInvoices from '@/app/ui/dashboard/latest-invoices';  
import { lusitana } from '@/app/ui/fonts';  
  
import { Suspense } from 'react';  
import {CardsSkeleton, RevenueChartSkeleton, LatestInvoicesSkeleton} from '../ui/skeletons';  
  
export default async function Page() {  
    return (  
        <main>  
            <h1 className={`${lusitana.className} mb-4 text-xl md:text-2xl`}>  
                Dashboard  
            </h1>  
            <div className="grid gap-6 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4">  
                <Suspense fallback={<CardsSkeleton />}>  
                    <CardWrapper />  
                </Suspense>  
            </div>  
            <div className="mt-6 grid grid-cols-1 gap-6 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-8">  
                <Suspense fallback={<RevenueChartSkeleton />}>  
                    <RevenueChart />  
                </Suspense>  
                <Suspense fallback={<LatestInvoicesSkeleton />}>  
                    <LatestInvoices />  
                </Suspense>  
            </div>  
        </main>  
    );  
}
```

## Quick Recap: Stream Page vs Stream Components

Streaming a whole page means showing a loading state (loading.tsx) until fetch finishes and renders

Steaming a component means a `<Suspense>` component wraps a component that needs a loading state until fetch finishes and renders. The Suspense gets provided a fallback component that shows during loading state. That fallback component could be a spinner animation or even better, a skeleton outline of the text and images that will appear.

## Static, Dynamic, Partial Rerendering

Components and pages that are static means they are cached at build time and delivered to user’s web browser. Dynamic content will be freshly fetched at runtime.

### **Heuristics**
NextJS decides if your content will be preloaded when you run build (build time) or when the user uses the app (run time)

1. **Static Routes  
	- E.g., /about, /contact
	- **Default Behavior**: The `fetch` call made in a static route is cached at build time by default. This means the data is fetched once, and the page is pre-rendered as static HTML with that data.
	- **Override Option**: If you use the option `cache: 'no-store'` with `fetch`, it disables caching and forces a runtime fetch on every request.  

2. **Dynamic Routes**
	- E.g., /blog/[id], /product/[slug]
	- **Without generateStaticParams**: If you have a dynamic route (with URL segments like `/posts/[id]`) and you don’t use `generateStaticParams`, Next.js will render those pages at runtime. This means each request will trigger a fetch (unless you configure the fetch to cache using other Next.js caching options) because the page isn’t pre-generated.
	- **With generateStaticParams**: Using `generateStaticParams` on a dynamic route allows the pages to be pre-rendered at build time with the generated parameters. Those static pages receive the generated params in the default exported component, and the fetch occurs during build time (or is cached based on your fetch configuration).
3. Dynamic functions  
	- In Next.js, if you call a [dynamic function](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers#dynamic-functions) in a route (like querying your database), the _entire_ route becomes dynamic.
	  Eg.
	```
	export async function fetchCustomers() {  
	  try {  
	    const customers = await sql<CustomerField[]>`  
	      SELECT  
	        id,  
	        name  
	      FROM customers  
	      ORDER BY name ASC  
	    `;  
	  
	    return customers;  
	  } catch (err) {  
	    console.error('Database Error:', err);  
	    throw new Error('Failed to fetch all customers.');  
	  }  
	}
	```

### Partial Prerendering

In modern web applications, rendering typically falls into two categories: static or dynamic, either for the entire app or specific routes. However, most routes aren’t purely static or dynamic.

Take an e-commerce site, for example—you may want to statically render the majority of a product page for performance, while dynamically fetching the user’s cart and personalized recommendations to enhance their experience.

Next.js 14 introduced an experimental version of **Partial Prerendering (PPR)** – a new rendering model that allows you to combine the benefits of static and dynamic rendering in the same route. We had used Suspense to show loading sprite until the data is fetched and rendered. NextJS’s Partial Prerendering can tell when a component is dynamic along with static components by following the above heuristics 1-3, but you must have the Suspense to mark the boundaries of the static page and the dynamic components in order to use PPR, as a matter of strict rules.

Some components on the page will be pre-rendered, while some others are left to be fetched and rendered in while user opens the page in runtime:
![[Pasted image 20250308040120.png]]

To enable PPR, there are two steps
1. At NextJS’s config (next.config.ts), add experimental ppr:
```
import type { NextConfig } from 'next';  
   
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {  
  experimental: {  
    ppr: 'incremental'  
  }  
};  
   
export default nextConfig;
```

^ The `'incremental'` value allows you to adopt PPR for specific route, so at your specific route, you have to enable `experimental_ppr`  flag

2. At your dashboard layout file or desired page, enable `experimental_ppr` flag:
	```
	import SideNav from '@/app/ui/dashboard/sidenav';  
	   
	export const experimental_ppr = true;  
	   
	// ...  
	// Some components wrapped in Suspense for dynamic parts
	```

>[!note] Differences from official docs:
>
> The official docs will have fetching for all cards initially at dashboard page.tsx then at a later chapter have you move the fetching to the individual cards’ component files. The official docs also have CardWrapper implementation at dashboard page.tsx, then at a later chapter have you move the code into its own Cardwrapper component. This is all unnecessary steps when the main purpose is to teach fetching. So our docs have the code setup from the start without having you to move code later.
