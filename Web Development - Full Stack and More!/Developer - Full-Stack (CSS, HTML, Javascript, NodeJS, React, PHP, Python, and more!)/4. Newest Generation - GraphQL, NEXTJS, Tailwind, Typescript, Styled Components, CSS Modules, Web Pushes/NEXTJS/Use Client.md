The "use client"; directive may be found at the top of a js file. Particularly when using Next.js 13 or later with its new "app" directory structure, you may see "use client". This directive is used to indicate that a particular component or module should only run on the client side, not on the server.

In the context of Next.js:

Server-side rendering (SSR): **By default**, Next.js pre-renders pages on the server, which means the initial HTML is generated on the server and sent to the client. This is beneficial for SEO and performance, especially for the initial page load.

Client-side rendering (CSR): Sometimes, you might want certain components or logic to run only in the browser, perhaps because they rely on browser-specific APIs, or you want to offload certain computations to the client.

Using "use client"; at the top of a file tells Next.js to skip server-side rendering for that file or component, ensuring it's only executed in the client's browser. This can be particularly useful for components that heavily rely on window or document objects, which are only available in the browser, or for components that should only render client-side for performance reasons.

If you're not using Next.js or its specific version that supports this feature, this directive won't have any effect and could be removed.
