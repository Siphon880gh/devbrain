Starting a TypeScript project for Node.js involves several steps. TypeScript offers static type-checking, which can help catch potential runtime errors during development. Here's how you can set up TypeScript with Node.js:

1. **Initialize a New Project**

   If you haven't already, start by creating a new directory for your project and initializing it with npm:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-ts-project
   cd my-ts-project
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Install TypeScript and Node.js Type Definitions**

   Next, install TypeScript and the Node.js type definitions:

   ```bash
   npm install typescript --save-dev
   npm install @types/node --save-dev
   ```

3. **Initialize TypeScript Configuration**

   Create a `tsconfig.json` file for TypeScript compiler options:

   ```bash
   npx tsc --init
   ```

   Modify the `tsconfig.json` to suit Node.js development. For instance:

   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "target": "es2020",
       "module": "commonjs",
       "strict": true,
       "esModuleInterop": true,
       "skipLibCheck": true,
       "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
       "outDir": "./dist"
     },
     "include": ["src/**/*.ts"],
     "exclude": ["node_modules"]
   }
   ```

   This setup assumes you'll place your TypeScript source files in a `src` directory and the compiled JavaScript files will go to the `dist` directory.

4. **Setting Up a Sample TypeScript File**

   Create a `src` directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir src
   ```

   Inside the `src` directory, create an example TypeScript file `index.ts`:

   ```typescript
   const message: string = 'Hello, Node.js with TypeScript!';
   console.log(message);
   ```

5. **Add Compilation Scripts**

   In your `package.json`, add a script to compile your TypeScript files:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "build": "tsc",
     "start": "node dist/index.js"
   }
   ```

   With this setup, you can run `npm run build` to compile your TypeScript code and `npm start` to execute your Node.js application.

6. **Development with Nodemon and ts-node**

   If you want to auto-restart your Node.js application when source files change, `nodemon` can be combined with `ts-node` for a smoother development experience:

   ```bash
   npm install nodemon ts-node --save-dev
   ```

   Update your `package.json` scripts:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "build": "tsc",
     "start": "node dist/index.js",
     "dev": "nodemon --watch 'src/**/*.ts' --exec 'ts-node' src/index.ts"
   }
   ```

   Now, you can use `npm run dev` to start your project in development mode. The application will auto-restart when you modify any `.ts` file.

7. **Start Developing!**

   With everything set up, you can now start developing your Node.js application with TypeScript. Remember to use `npm run build` to compile your TypeScript code to JavaScript and `npm start` to run it. During development, you can use `npm run dev` to have your application auto-restart on changes.

Remember, this is a basic setup. Depending on your needs, you may want to add other tools, libraries, or configurations to optimize your development process.
