Main points:
- tsc
- Config file so can watch your file changes
- Compiles ts to js
- Backward compatibility eg await Async
- Minimizes developer error
	- ts file hooks into the vs code linting system
	- You can declare types to variables, parameters, objects (using interface) and the linter will dynamically adjust to stop you from assigning or passing in the wrong data type to a variable/parameter/key etc
	- you have to be explicit about reassigning a value to another data type than it was originally assigned
- Semantic about your data. Previously js was loosely typed unlike other languages
