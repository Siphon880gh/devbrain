Please use the same code from [[3. Supabase Authentication Adding into Existing Project]]

We will add an alternate login/sign up that uses Google OAuth:

At Supabase, go to Authentication section -> Sign In / Up

Note it includes many Auth Providers (not all shown here). Let's click the "Disabled" button at Google in order to switch it to "Enabled":

A right sidebar interrupts you. Copy the callback url to a safe place for now.
![[Pasted image 20250317040905.png]]

Although the Client ID was auto populated by Supabase, spaces are not allowed. Clicking Save will trigger this error:
![[Pasted image 20250317041507.png]]

Go to Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) for your Client ID's.
- **Previous Challenge?**
	- You may use the same Google Cloud Project from [[2. Login Signup Google OAuth2 with NextAuth JS]] where you've implemented Google OAuth2 on NextJS using NextAuth (NOT Supabase).
- **Find Your Google OAuth Client ID(s):
    - Navigate to `APIs & Services` â†’ `Credentials`.
      ![[Pasted image 20250316023016.png]]
	  
    - Locate your **OAuth 2.0 Client ID AND Client Secret**
	    - Looks like `1234567890-xyz.apps.googleusercontent.com`.
	    - Your **Client ID** is in the table. The **Client Secret** is found in full print on the page after clicking the Edit icon:
		  ![[Pasted image 20250316024238.png]]
	
Enter Client ID and Client Secret back at Supabase to continue enabling Google OAuth. Then click Save.

At the list of providers, check that Google is Enabled. If not, then you made a mistake in configuring:

Layout wise, add this Google button to login and sign up pages, above the Login / Sign up buttons

For `app/(auth-pages)/login/page.tsx`:
```
	{/* Google OAuth Button */}  
	<button  
	  type="button"  
	  className="mt-4 w-full bg-red-600 text-white py-2 rounded-md flex justify-center items-center"  
	  onClick={() => {}}  
>  
	  Login with Google  
	</button>
```

![[Pasted image 20250317044901.png]]

For `app/(auth-pages)/signup/page.tsx`:
```
  {/* Google OAuth Button */}  
  <button  
	type="button"  
	className="mt-4 w-full bg-red-600 text-white py-2 rounded-md flex justify-center items-center"  
	onClick={() => {}}  
> 
	Sign Up with Google  
  </button>
```
