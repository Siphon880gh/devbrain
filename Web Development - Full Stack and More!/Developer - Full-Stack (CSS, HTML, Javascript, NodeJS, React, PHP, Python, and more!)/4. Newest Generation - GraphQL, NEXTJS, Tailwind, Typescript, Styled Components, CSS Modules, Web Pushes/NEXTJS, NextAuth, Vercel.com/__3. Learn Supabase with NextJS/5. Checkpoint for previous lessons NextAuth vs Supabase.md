 NextAuth is a library that makes implementing a postgreSQL database for signup / login / Google OAuth2 easy on NextJS (Btw AuthJS for other React builds). 
 - The postgreSQL database can be from Neon or your own computer's postgreSQL (And with pgAdmin 4 with a gui, it's easy to manage)

Authentication using NextJS / Neon / Local PostgreSQL means you need to leverage a database table called "users", then use CRUD operations with bcrypt hashing and comparing in order to implement signup / login / forget password.

Supabase is a backend as a service similar to Firebase/Firestore by Google. In fact, they're inspired by them, and hence the suffix "-base". This backend service has databases (in lieu of Vercel Neon posgreSQL database). Supabase also has authentication services.

Supabase Auth is DECOUPLED from Supabase databases. The Authentication service has their own dashboard of users. You don't need a database that has a table called users.
