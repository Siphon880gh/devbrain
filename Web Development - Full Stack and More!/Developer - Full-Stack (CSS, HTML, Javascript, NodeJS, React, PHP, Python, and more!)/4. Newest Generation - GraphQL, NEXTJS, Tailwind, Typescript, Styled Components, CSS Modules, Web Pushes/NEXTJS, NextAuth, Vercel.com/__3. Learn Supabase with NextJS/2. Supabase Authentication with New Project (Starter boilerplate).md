## Setup

Create a Supabase project at http://app.supabase.com/ (You can sign up for a free account). Then you can modify but there are already defaults in authentication settings:
   - Set up redirect URLs in your Supabase dashboard
   - Configure email templates if using email authentication
   - Set up any OAuth providers you want to use

Start new NextJS project with supabase generated boilerplate:
```
npx create-next-app -e with-supabase
```

Btw these instructions are for these versions:
- "name": ["@supabase/auth-js",..](mailto:"@supabase/auth-js",.. "mailto:"@supabase/auth-js",..") "version": "2.68.0",
- "name": ["@supabase/ssr",..](mailto:"@supabase/ssr",.. "mailto:"@supabase/ssr",..") "version": "0.5.2",

Setup .env file with the url and anon from your Supabase project’s :
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[Your Supabase Project URL]
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[Your Supabase Project Anon Key]
```

## Taking a look at the code - not the best learning material

Your app now has all the authentication features: sign up / login / forget password.

But if you look at the starter boilerplate code generated that has Supabase, it is unnecessarily complicated. It may be a conspiracy for NextJS to make things complicated so you use NextJS with Supabase (instead of other React builds), which tends to pipeline you into their Vercel deployment and Neon database offerings.

How they made it difficult to glean through the code to learn Supabase (not exhaustive list):
- They have used shadcn that created component files for many of the elements on the webpages like button and labels.
- While their other boilerplates often have the `{action}` passed to the form tag's action attribute, this starter boilerplate has the action passed from components/submit-button.tsx  to components/ui/button.tsx, which uses the `<button formAction={..}` syntax instead of the `<form action={}` syntax, which are equivalents.
- Excessive utilities. There is a `middleware` at root, but that `middleware` also imports another file named middleware at `utils/supabase/middleware.ts`
- Excessive utilities. Other ways besides the middleware.
- Appears to have other files that may be referenced by other tutorials, crowding the space of what's supposed to be only a NextJS with supabase boilerplate
- Having the functions/pages/components named Sign-In and Sign-Up, which complicates reading code more than it should have to. The next challenge will use the words "Login" and "Signup" instead.

**Therefore, we will learn Supabase in-depth in the next tutorial where we implement Supabase from scratch (Using a blank NextJS project).** The final result would be similar code to the boilerplate in regards to sign up / login / forget password, but debulked so that you can make it your own. That will be [[3. Supabase Authentication Adding into Existing Project]]

The rest of this tutorial is to quickly orientate to email template and test that the boilerplate works for auth functions.

## Testing

Let’s test it
Visit localhost:3000/

![[Pasted image 20250317035035.png]]

Sign up at the top right
![[Pasted image 20250317035850.png]]

Check your email to confirm. When clicking confirm button, it’ll send you to the protected page at localhost:3000

## (FYI - Email Template)

You can modify the confirmation email at supabase:
![[Pasted image 20250317035917.png]]

As of Sep 3 2024, Supabase limits to 2 emails per hour. You can only change this with your own [custom SMTP setup](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-smtp). Refer to [https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-smtp](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-smtp)
