Study these examples of grouping and layout.tsx folder structures and their effects on layout(s) wrapping children.

### **Example: Higher-Level Layout for Shared Layouts**

#### **Example Structure:**
```
app/
 layout.tsx  <-- Shared layout for both groups
 (marketing)/  
   page.tsx   <-- Main home page focuses on marketing at URL: `localhost:3000/`
   about/  
	page.tsx  <-- URL: `localhost:3000/about`  
 blog/
  page.tsx  <-- URL: `localhost:3000/blog`  
```

#### **How it Works?**

- Since `layout.tsx` is outside of `(marketing)/about/` directory  and `blog/` directory, but there is no dedicated `layout.tsx` in those two directories, both urls `localhost:3000/about/` and `localhost:3000/blog/` will use that outside `layout.tsx`. And of course the main page at url `localhost:3000/` also uses that `layout.tsx`. The main page is located at `(marketing)/page.tsx` because folders named with enclosing parentheses are not part of any url path.

### **Example: Route Group with a Scoped Layout Gets Layouts Nested**

Folder structure:
```
app/  
  layout.tsx  <-- Global layout. Has text "OUTER".
  (like-this)/  <-- Group folder (not part of the URL)  
    layout.tsx  <-- Layout scoped to this group. Has text "INNER".
    page.tsx  <-- URL: `localhost:3000/`  
    dashboard/  
      page.tsx  <-- URL: `localhost:3000/dashboard`  
```

#### What Happens?

- Pages inside `./(like-this)/` will **use `./(like-this)/layout.tsx`** which gets wrapped by `./layout.tsx`.

- The URL remains clean (`/dashboard` instead of `/(like-this)/dashboard`).

### **Example: Route Groups with and without a Scoped Layout

Folder structure:
```
app/  
  layout.tsx  <-- Global layout. Has text "OUTER"  
  (marketing)/  <-- Route group for marketing pages  
    layout.tsx  <-- Scoped layout. Has text "INNER"
    page.tsx  <-- Main home page focuses on marketing at URL: `localhost:3000/`
    about/  
      page.tsx  <-- URL: `localhost:3000/about`  
  blog/
    page.tsx  <-- URL: `localhost:3000/blog`
```

#### **How it Works?**

- Both `(marketing)/page.tsx` (which is main home page) and `(marketing)/about/page.tsx` uses the scoped `(marketing)/layout.tsx`. And that scoped layout.tsx is wrapped inside the global layout.tsx
	- OR: localhost:3000/
	- OR: localhost:3000/about/

	  B:
	  ![[Pasted image 20250318025159.png]]

- However `blog/page.tsx` which is served at the url `localhost:3000/blog/` is only wrapped by the global layout.tsx because the file is not "aware" of the scoped layout.tsx where it's at in the folder structure:

### **What If: Conflicting pages will yield to outer page
```
app/
 layout.tsx  <-- Global Layout. Has text "OUTER"
 page.tsx <-- True main home page at "localhost:3000/"
 (marketing)/  
   page.tsx  <-- Could've been home page at "localhost:3000/" but yielded and overridden
```

---

### **What If: Conflicting pages at same grouped level will fail
```
app/
 layout.tsx  <-- Global Layout
 (marketing)/  
   page.tsx
 (sales)/  
   page.tsx
```

You'll get the error:
```
Error: ./src/app/(marketing)
You cannot have two parallel pages that resolve to the same path.
```

It will still fail if you have an outer page.tsx.
This won't fix it:
```
app/
 layout.tsx  <-- Global Layout
 page.tsx <-- Outer page.tsx but doesn't matter
 (marketing)/  
   page.tsx
 (sales)/  
   page.tsx
```
