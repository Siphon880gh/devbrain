**Note:**

**NextAuth v5 has breaking changes** that **differs significantly from v4**.  
We are using NetAuth v5.0.0-beta.25 as of 3/2025 after running `npm install next-auth@beta`. One of the changes is not needing to npm install `@auth/google-provider` because it’s already included into next-auth. The [...nextauth] dynamic route still is required because it allows NextAuth.js to handle multiple endpoints (signin, signout, callback, etc.). However [...nextauth] route for Google Auth is simplified:  the `handle` method **does not exist** in NextAuth v5 anymore and simply importing/exporting `authConfig` for both `GET` and `POST` ensures Next.js correctly routes requests. ChatGPT as of 3/2025 is NOT good at giving you the correct information for this.

Google Cloud Console side:

1. First, set up your Google Cloud Console project:
	- Go to the [Google Cloud Console]([https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/))
	- Create a new project or select an existing one
	  
		![[Pasted image 20250316022951.png]]

	- Enable the Google+ API
	  ![[Pasted image 20250316023016.png]]
	  
	- Then:
	  ![[Pasted image 20250316023054.png]]
	
	- Go to Credentials → Create Credentials → OAuth Client ID
	  ![[Pasted image 20250316023124.png]]
	
	  - Then:
	    ![[Pasted image 20250316023147.png]]

  
	- Finally:
	  ![[Pasted image 20250316023523.png]]
	
	- If asked to setup the OAuth consent screen first when setting up OAuth client ID, go ahead and set up like they asked:
	- Workflow Step  1: App name that user will see asking for permission and Support email (may be gmail)
	- Workflow Step  2: Audience internal or external (external requires verification of your app, so just choose internal for now)
	- Workflow Step  3: Contact information for Google to notify you about your app
	- Workflow Step 4: Agreement
	- If had to create OAuth consent screen, now create the OAuth Client:
	  ![[Pasted image 20250316023813.png]]

- Then you add URI(s)
	- FYI, Authorized JavaScript origins is for requests from a browser; 
	- FYI, Authorized redirect URIs is for requests from a web server
	- **For our purposes (We will first test local development Google OAuth. Change these to your deployed url’s later)**
		- Add Javascript origin: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
		- Add Redirect URIs (e.g., `[http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google](http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google)` for development)
- Note down your Client ID and Client Secret
	- Your Client ID is in the table. The Client secret is on the page from Editing:
	  ![[Pasted image 20250316024238.png]]
- FAQ: Do we need billing linked to the project? > No.

Add environment variables:  

.env:
```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here  
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here  
NEXTAUTH_URL=[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  
AUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret_here  
```  

Note your AUTH_SECRET may have already been generated in previous challenges like [[16a). Authentication with NextAuth JS]]. If not, refer to that lesson searching for "AUTH_SECRET"

---

Layout wise, add this Google button to login, above the Login button at `app/src/app/ui/login-form.tsx`:
```
import { signIn } from 'next-auth/react';  
// ...  
  
        {/* Google Login Button */}  
        <button  
          type="button"  
          className="mt-4 w-full bg-red-600 text-white py-2 rounded-md flex justify-center items-center"  
          onClick={() => signIn('google')}  
        >  
          Sign in with Google  
        </button>
```

Note we’re adding it to Login Form. You may choose to add it to Sign up Form as well. The same Google Oauth will sign you up if you haven’t been signed up, otherwise logs you in.

Enhance auth.ts (we can leave auth.config.ts alone because its bare minimum config gets spread out, and then overridden anyways inside auth.ts). We will add to the `NextAuth({`  that initializes and returns many functions like signOut, signIn, etc that gets exported.
- Add to providers array:
	```
	import GoogleProvider from 'next-auth/providers/google';  
	  
	// ...  
	  
	  providers: [  
	    GoogleProvider({  
	      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID!,  
	      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET!,  
	      authorization: {  
	        params: {  
	          prompt: 'consent',  
	          access_type: 'offline',  
	          response_type: 'code'  
	        }  
	      }  
	    }),
	```
- Add as the final key/value of NextAuth:
	```
	secret: process.env.AUTH_SECRET,
	```
- Export handlers
```
export const { handlers: {GET,POST}, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({
```

Checkpoint - In the end, your NextAuth might look like:
```
export const { handlers: {GET,POST}, auth, signIn, signOut } = NextAuth({  
  ...authConfig,  
  providers: [  
    GoogleProvider({  
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID!,  
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET!,  
      authorization: {  
        params: {  
          prompt: 'consent',  
          access_type: 'offline',  
          response_type: 'code'  
        }  
      }  
    }),  
    Credentials({  
      async authorize(credentials) {  
        const parsedCredentials = z  
          .object({   
            email: z.string().email(),   
            password: z.string().min(6) })  
          .safeParse(credentials);  
   
        if (parsedCredentials.success) {  
          const { email, password } = parsedCredentials.data;  
          const user = await getUser(email);  
          if (!user) return null;  
          const passwordsMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);  
   
          if (passwordsMatch) return user;  
        } else {  
          console.log('Invalid credentials');  
          return null;  
        }  
   
      },  
    }),  
  ],  
  secret: process.env.AUTH_SECRET,  
});
```

Finally, setup the dynamic route to make this all possible:
![[Pasted image 20250316024641.png]]

Create `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` :
```
export {GET,POST} from "@/auth"
```

Start or restart the dev server in local development:
```
npm run dev
```

Visit login page http://localhost:3000/login

You should see:

Clicking "Sign in with Google" should show Consent page:
