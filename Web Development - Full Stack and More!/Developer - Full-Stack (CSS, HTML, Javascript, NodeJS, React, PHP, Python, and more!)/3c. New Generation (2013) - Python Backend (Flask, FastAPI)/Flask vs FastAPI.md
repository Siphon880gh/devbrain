## 🔄 **FastAPI vs Flask – Quick Comparison**

| Feature                         | **FastAPI**                      | **Flask**                               |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Async Support**               | ✅ Built-in (`async def`)         | ❌ Not natively async (need extensions)  |
| **Type Hints / Autocompletion** | ✅ Full support via Pydantic      | ❌ Not built-in; manual validation       |
| **Data Validation**             | ✅ Automatic via Pydantic         | ❌ Manual or with third-party libs       |
| **Interactive API Docs**        | ✅ Auto-generates Swagger & ReDoc | ❌ Requires Flask-RESTX or similar       |
| **Performance**                 | 🚀 High (Starlette + async I/O)  | 🐢 Slower (WSGI + sync only by default) |
| **Dependency Injection**        | ✅ First-class, built-in          | ❌ Not built-in                          |
| **Ease of Use**                 | ✅ Modern, clean syntax           | ✅ Simple and familiar                   |
| **Maturity / Ecosystem**        | ⚠️ Newer (2018), growing fast    | ✅ Mature, huge ecosystem                |

## ✅ Use **FastAPI** if:

- You need high performance or async support (e.g., WebSockets, background tasks).
- You want automatic request validation and documentation.
- You're working with typed Python code and want better dev tooling.

## ✅ Use **Flask** if:

- You're building a small app quickly with minimal tooling.
- You're already familiar with its ecosystem or extensions.
- You’re using it in a monolithic app or want very fine-grained control.
