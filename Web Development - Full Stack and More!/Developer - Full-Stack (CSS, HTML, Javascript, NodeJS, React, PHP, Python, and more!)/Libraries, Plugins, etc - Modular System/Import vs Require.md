**Import vs Require**

In JavaScript, `import` and `require` are two different ways to include modules and libraries in your code, but they are not exclusively tied to the environments (browsers vs Node.js) as implied. Here's a clearer distinction:

**1. Import (ES Modules):**
- `import` is part of ES Modules, a standard in JavaScript for working with modules.
- It's supported in modern browsers and can be used with Node.js (from version 13.2.0 with ES module support).
- Syntax: `import Library from "./library";`
- In browsers, you can use `<script type="module" src="..."></script>` to utilize ES Modules.
- ES Modules allow static analysis and tree shaking due to their static structure.

**Example:**
```javascript
import Library from "./library";
export default someFunctionOrClassOrObject;
```

**2. Require (CommonJS):**
- `require` is part of CommonJS, widely used in Node.js for module management.
- CommonJS is not natively supported in browsers, hence typically used in Node.js environments.
- Syntax: `const Library = require("library");`
- When using tools like webpack or Browserify, you can use `require` in a browser context as these tools bundle the modules appropriately.
	- FYI: Yes, you can use `require` in your JavaScript files, even though browsers don't natively support CommonJS modules (which use `require`). Webpack, Browserify, and similar bundlers allow you to write your JavaScript code using `require` to include modules, just as you would in a Node.js environment. These tools then process your code, resolving the `require` calls and bundling your modules together into a single JavaScript file (or sometimes multiple files, depending on your configuration). This bundled file is compatible with browsers, as the bundler wraps the modules in a way that manages their dependencies and execution correctly in a browser environment.

**Example:**
```javascript
const Library = require("library");
module.exports = someFunctionOrClassOrObject;
```

**Path Prefixes:**
- Start the path with "./" when referring to a local file.
- If it's a module installed in your `node_modules` directory (like a package installed via npm), you typically omit "./" and refer to the module by name.

**Summary:**
It's not just about browsers vs npm/node builders. Both `import` and `require` have their use cases depending on the environment and the type of modules you're working with. While `import` is more modern and supports tree shaking, `require` has been a staple in Node.js for a long time.
