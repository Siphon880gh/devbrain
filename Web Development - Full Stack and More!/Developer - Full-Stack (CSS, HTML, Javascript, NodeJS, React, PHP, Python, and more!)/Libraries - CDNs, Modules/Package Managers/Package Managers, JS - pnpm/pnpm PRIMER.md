A npm alternative is pnpm (Performant npm) to init, install, and manage the packages.

Just like npm, it uses package.json  and the package.json contents donâ€™t need to be adjusted for pnpm to work.

NextJS documents officially recommend pnpm over npm. It uses less space, is faster, and has better version conciliation.

To init a project to have a package.json:
```
pnpm init
```

If there already is a package.json in a code repo, choose either npm or pnpm (Performant npm) to install and manage:
```
pnpm install
```

To reset to a new redownload of package modules:
1. delete package-lock.json 
2. delete pnpm-lock.yaml 
3. Then install packages

Commands are pretty similar with some differences.

Some command differences include:
`pnpm cache delete` instead of `npm cache clean`
