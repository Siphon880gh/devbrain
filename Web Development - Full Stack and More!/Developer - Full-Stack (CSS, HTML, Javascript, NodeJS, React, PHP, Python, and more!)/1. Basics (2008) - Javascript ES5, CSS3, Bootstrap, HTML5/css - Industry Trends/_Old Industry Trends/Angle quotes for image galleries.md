Was an old trend in image galleries that show one image at a time, and arrows on the sides are for the  user to cycle through images. Those were either normal arrows or double angle quotes or single angle quotes

The characters ‹ and › are guillemets or angle quotes, and there are double angle quotes: « and ». They came from the French language.
