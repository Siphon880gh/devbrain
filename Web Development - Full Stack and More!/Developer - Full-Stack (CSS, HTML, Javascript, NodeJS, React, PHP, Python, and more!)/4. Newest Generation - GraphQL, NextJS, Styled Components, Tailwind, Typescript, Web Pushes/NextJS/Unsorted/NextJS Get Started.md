### 1. Setup

#### Prerequisites:
- Ensure you have Node.js (version 10.13 or later) installed on your machine.

#### Create a Next.js App:
1. **Create a new project:** Open your terminal and use the following command to create a new Next.js app. Replace `my-next-app` with your project name.
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app my-next-app
   ```
   This command creates a new folder named `my-next-app` with a pre-configured Next.js project.
   
   If you don't have create-next-app (npm install create-next-app) or its dependency next (npm install next) installed, the npx will ask you to install automatically.


Nuances:
If you always want latest version of Next JS, it'll ask to install if necessary if you ran:
```
npx create-next-app my-next-app
```

If you don't want to type so much, just run this command and the series of questions will include name of your new app:
```
npx create-next-app
```


2. **Navigate into your project:** Change into your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd my-next-app
   ```

3. **Start the development server:** Run the following command to start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This command starts a local development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open this URL in your browser to see your Next.js app.

### 2. Project Structure Overview
After creating your app, you'll find the following key files and directories in your project:
- `pages/`: Contains your application's pages. Each .js, .jsx, .ts, or .tsx file inside this directory corresponds to a route based on its file name.
  - `index.js`: The entry point of your site, corresponding to the `/` route.
- `public/`: Static assets like images can be placed here and accessed via the root URL.
- `styles/`: Global CSS files can be placed here.

### 3. Creating Pages
Creating a new page is as simple as creating a new file under the `pages` directory. For example:
- Create `about.js` in the `pages` directory for an About page. Access it at `/about`.

### 4. Adding Styles
Next.js supports CSS Modules and global CSS out of the box. To style your components:
- **For global styles**, import CSS files in your `pages/_app.js`.
- **For component-level styles**, use CSS Modules by creating a `.module.css` file and importing it into your component file.

### 5. Deploying Your Next.js App
You can deploy your Next.js app to various hosting providers like Vercel (the creators of Next.js), Netlify, or others. Vercel is the most straightforward option for deploying Next.js apps, offering seamless integration:
1. Push your project to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
2. Import your project in Vercel from your Git repository.
3. Vercel will automatically deploy your app and provide a live URL.
