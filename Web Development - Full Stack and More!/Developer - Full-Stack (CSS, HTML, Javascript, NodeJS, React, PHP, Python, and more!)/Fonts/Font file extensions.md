1. **TTF and OTF**: These are file format extensions where TTF stands for TrueType Font, and OTF stands for OpenType Font. OTF is a more recent format that can include a larger character set and more advanced typographic features.
2. **WOFF (Web Open Font Format)**:
    
    - **WOFF** was developed for use with web pages and is essentially a compressed version of an OpenType (OTF) or TrueType (TTF) font, with additional metadata.
    - **WOFF2** is an update to the original WOFF format. It offers improved compression and therefore smaller file sizes, which is beneficial for web performance.
3. **EOT (Embedded OpenType)**:
    
    - This format was developed by Microsoft specifically for use as embedded fonts on web pages.
    - EOT fonts are often used in older versions of Internet Explorer, but with the rise of WOFF, their usage has declined.
4. **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) Font**:
    
    - SVG fonts are part of the SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) specification and can be used to define fonts within SVG documents.
    - This format has been deprecated in SVG 2.0 and is now considered obsolete for use as a font format on the web. However, it can still be found in some older content or for specific design purposes.
