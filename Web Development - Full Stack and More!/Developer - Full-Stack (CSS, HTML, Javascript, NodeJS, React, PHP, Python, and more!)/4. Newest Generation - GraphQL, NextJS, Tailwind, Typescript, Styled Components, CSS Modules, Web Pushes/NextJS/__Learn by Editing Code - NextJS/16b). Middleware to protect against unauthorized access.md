>[!note] Note swapped official doc's Chapter 14 and 15.
>
>The official docs have Chapter 14 for Accessibility, Chapter 15 for Authentication, and Chapter 16 for Meta tag, which is a strange order. For our docs, we have Chapter 14 and (15) for Accessibility and Meta tag; And, Chapter (16) will be for Authentication (including Middleware to protect pages) which is a more advanced topic.

>[!note] Official docs differences
>The official docs ([https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/adding-authentication](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/adding-authentication)) will have you work on old code from previous challenges then add login page and protect dashboard routes to authenticated users only using middleware. However, it doesnâ€™t go into details on the why it works. It also skips out on the sign up page. My lesson will start from a blank project (but using the same database), so you can get a detailed undistracted look at how authentication works.
>
>Protecting pages with middleware is a separate lesson 16b. so that you get the basics of authentication without intertwining it with middleware.
