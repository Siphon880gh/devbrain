Review of CRUD:
- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete

So far we've only read from the database while rendering invoices and earlier, while rendering the cards at the dashboard home. Mutation is a catch all for the reading, updating, and deleting of specific information to the database.

Recall that NextJS does not require a separate server running at another port. NextJS components can be server components, we retrieved data from the database Postgres directly and rendering it directly all within the components (no need for an intermediate json or fetching to and receiving at url endpoints).

Orientation: Invoice, Zod

We can continue off working on Invoices from the previous challenge. 

When creating/updating Invoices, the code will take the user's inputs. There is a chance of mistakes, so you want to validate the user's inputs. A library that makes it easy to validate runtime user inputs is Zod.

---

Orientation: Forms

There are different ways we can take user inputs from the webpage and send it to updating or creating in the database. One of the more traditional ways is the action attribute of a form. Recall that action form works like this:
```
<form action="process.php">...</form>
```

^ Back in the older days, upon user submitting the form, that PHP page (at action attribute) will take all the user inputs from the form then decide to save or create in the database and decide what HTML to send back to the user to see next.

We will be instead passing in a function called **Server Action** in NextJS terminology. By adding theÂ `'use server'`, you mark all the exported functions within a file as Server Actions. These server functions can then be imported and used in Client and Server components.

While this seems to draw a parallel, no, the **Server Action** isn't named as an action because of form actions. While a form is a common way to use Server Actions, you can also call **server actions directly** from client-side components.

Concept code (We're not coding it yet):
```
// Server Component
export default function Page() {
  // Action
  async function create(formData: FormData) {
    'use server';
 
    // Logic to mutate data...
  }
 
  // Invoke the action using the "action" attribute
  return <form action={create}>...</form>;
}
```

When you click "Create Invoice" at the invoices page, it'll open `localhots:3000/dashboard/invoices/create` which is going to be 404 because we haven't defined a page at that route
![[Pasted image 20250308194331.png]]

Create `dashboard/invoices/create/page.tsx`.
- Folder structure should look like
  ![[Pasted image 20250308220718.png]]
- We will have a form where we can input information to create a new invoice, however like the previous challenge, user jobs (Searching invoices, managing invoices, navigating invoice pages) should be in their own components. So the create form page will render a create form component
- The page will fetch customers and pass it to the invoice form because the user should be able to select a customer to create the invoice:
```
import Form from '@/app/ui/invoices/create-form';
import Breadcrumbs from '@/app/ui/invoices/breadcrumbs';
import { fetchCustomers } from '@/app/lib/data';
 
export default async function Page() {
  const customers = await fetchCustomers();
 
  return (
    <main>
      <Form customers={customers} />
    </main>
  );
}
```


We take a quick look at the create form component `ui/invoices/create-form.tsx`:
- There is a form element though it's missing the action attribute which we discussed before about in general. We will be implementing that, but first we don't have any Server Actions defined yet.
- A select dropdown with options to select customer
- An input to enter an amount (Via a component CurrencyDollarIcon)
- A radio group to select either Pending or Paid.
- The code's already implemented at `ui/invoices/create-form`, other than the form's action attribute.

Visiting `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices/create` will show:

![[Pasted image 20250308202938.png]]

Create `nextjs-dashboard/app/lib/actions.ts`:
```
'use server';
 
import { z } from 'zod';
import postgres from 'postgres';

import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache';
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';

const sql = postgres(process.env.POSTGRES_URL!, { ssl: 'require' });

const FormSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  customerId: z.string(),
  amount: z.coerce.number(),
  status: z.enum(['pending', 'paid']),
  date: z.string(),
});
 
// Creates an object that has the method .parse to validate definitions
// Class convention of title casing as a hint it has definitions
const CreateInvoice = FormSchema.omit({ id: true, date: true });

export async function createInvoice(formData: FormData) {
    const { customerId, amount, status } = CreateInvoice.parse({
        customerId: formData.get('customerId'),
        amount: formData.get('amount'),
        status: formData.get('status'),
      });
      const amountInCents = amount * 100;
      const date = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
     
      await sql`
        INSERT INTO invoices (customer_id, amount, status, date)
        VALUES (${customerId}, ${amountInCents}, ${status}, ${date})
      `;


    revalidatePath('/dashboard/invoices'); // so do not pull from stale cache
    redirect('/dashboard/invoices');
} // createInvoice
```

Explanations:
- Zod has **already been installed** when you ran install against the package.json of the boilerplate, but you would have ran `npm install zod@3.24.1
- Zod creates an object `CreateInvoice` that has `.parse` method that fails if validation fails (the naming is it's parsing for specific keys and data types). It removed `id` and `date` from validation using `ForceSchema.omit` before finalizing on `CreateInvioce` that can parse.
- The FormSchema is the actual validation rules. Notice `z.coerce.number()` will typecast the user input to a number before validating (because input fields give you strings instead of numbers).
- The amount is stored as cents in the database for more precision.
- sql method from postgres lets the Server Action directly affect the database (in this case to `INSERT`).
- `revalidatePath` is from Next's cache package, it making sure to remove all caches at that url, so when the user or app goes to that url, it'll render the new information rather than cached information.
- Finally `redirect` makes sure to change the url and visit the invoices page.

Now that we have the `createInvoice` server action implemented, lets tie it to the form. At `nextjs-dashboard/app/ui/invoices/create-form.tsx`, import and add server action to form action (one line inserted, one line modified):
```
// ...  
import {createInvoice} from "@/app/lib/actions"
// ...
<form action={createInvoice}>
//...
```

Recall to view the create invoice form, it's at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices/create` (or click "Create Invoice" button at the Invoices page)
![[Pasted image 20250308202928.png]]

Create Amy Burns owing you $11.00
![[Pasted image 20250308213646.png]]

Now Amy appears at the Invoices page:
![[Pasted image 20250308213725.png]]

The new Amy invoice HAS TO appear at the top because the function `fetchFilteredInvoices` at `lib/data.ts` has a query that orders by date, and the new invoice is the latest:
```
WHERE
	customers.name ILIKE ${`%${query}%`} OR
	customers.email ILIKE ${`%${query}%`} OR
	invoices.amount::text ILIKE ${`%${query}%`} OR
	invoices.date::text ILIKE ${`%${query}%`} OR
	invoices.status ILIKE ${`%${query}%`}
ORDER BY invoices.date DESC
LIMIT ${ITEMS_PER_PAGE} OFFSET ${offset}
```

**Bonus**:

The page presenting the form looks a bit bare bones at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices/create`
![[Pasted image 20250308202928.png]]

We can add breadcrumbs so it's more polished and user-friendly:
![[Pasted image 20250308214115.png]]
We import the Breadcrumbs component defined elsewhere. Let's adjust `dashboard/invoices/create/page.tsx` (Add import line and Breadcrumb component lines):
```
import Form from '@/app/ui/invoices/create-form';
import Breadcrumbs from '@/app/ui/invoices/breadcrumbs';
import { fetchCustomers } from '@/app/lib/data';
 
export default async function Page() {
  const customers = await fetchCustomers();
 
  return (
    <main>
      <Breadcrumbs
        breadcrumbs={[
          { label: 'Invoices', href: '/dashboard/invoices' },
          {
            label: 'Create Invoice',
            href: '/dashboard/invoices/create',
            active: true,
          },
        ]}
      />
      <Form customers={customers} />
    </main>
  );
}
```

**Bonus?**:

The official docs implement edit and deleting, however we can choose to skip them because it's the same process as above for creating invoice. The SQL query of course is different (`UPDATE invoices...` and `UPDATE FROM invoices...`)

>[!note] Differences from official docs
>Instead of including breadcrumbs component at the starting code snippet of `dashboard/invoices/create/page.tsx` which can be confusing to the beginnerc following instructions, we've added that later in the lesson as an optional task to enhance the user experience.
