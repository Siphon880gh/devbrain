In the previous challenges, you've dealt with:
- `useSearchParams`
- `usePathname`
- `new URLSearchParams`
- `Page({params}...`

It's important to review their differences again so that the previous challenges are wrapped up.

### **URL Search Parameters (Query Params)**

- Found **after** the `?` in a URL.
- Consist of key-value pairs (`key=value`).
- Used for filtering, searching, and passing optional parameters.
- Multiple parameters are separated by `&`.
- Example:
    
    ```
    https://example.com/products?category=shoes&color=red
    ```
### **Pathname**

- The part of the URL **after the domain** but **before query parameters**.
- Represents the structure of the URL (excluding host and search params).
- Example:
    ```
    https://example.com/products/shoes
    ```
    - Pathname: `/products/shoes`

### **URL Route Parameters**

- Also known as URL Parameters
- Found within the URL **as part of the path itself**.
- Used for dynamic routing where the values change dynamically.
- Prefixed with `:` in backend route definitions.
- Example:
	```
	localhost:3000/products/123
	```
	- Here, `123` is a route parameter.
- Folder structure could be:
	```
	app/
	└── products/
	    └── [id]/
	        └── page.tsx
	```
- Then NextJS page.tsx you pull from the URL parameter `const {id} = await params;`
- And if the url was `localhots:3000/products/123`, then the const variable `id` will hold the value `123`.
