## Chapter 1 - NextJS dashboard boilerplate, pnpm install

### 1.1 Boilerplate

Download their boilerplate while starting a new NextJS app
```
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example" --use-pnpm
```

^ FYI, this follows the convention of many app starting convention, like expo: `npx create-expo YOUR_APP_NAME --example navigation`  so the formula is `npx create-NEW_TECH YOUR_APP NAME --example REPO_NAME_OR_URL`

At terminal, cd into the new nextjs-dashboard folder created:
```
cd nextjs-dashboard
```

You’ll see uses a React-like organization of files, typescript file formats, NextJs config files, and package.json to name a few:

Sneak peak: You notice placeholder data at app/lib/placeholder-data.ts. This mock data will be seeded into a postgreSQL database at Vercel.  At app/query/route.ts you’ll see commented-out implementation for an api endpoint to respond with data from postgreSQL. This example will be converted into a full stack app hosted at Vercel (by importing from your own Github repo).

### 1.2 Pnpm

Discussing files:
There is already a package.json. Choose either npm or pnpm (Performant npm)  to install  and manage the packages. NextJS recommends using pnpm. Commands are pretty similar with some differences. Let’s install with:
```
pnpm install
```

## Chapter 2 - Tailwind, clsx, css modules

### 2.1 Tailwind

Run hot reload dev server with either `npm run dev` or `pnpm dev`, whichever is appropriate.

You’ll see unstyled content on the web browser.

Import the global.css at the root layout.tsx:  
```  
import ['@/app/ui/global.css';](mailto:'@/app/ui/global.css'; "mailto:'@/app/ui/global.css';")  
```

You should see the page automatically refresh with styled content.

Discussing files and Tailwind styling:
See `{children}`  at the jsx in layout.tsx? That rolls in page.tsx into the jsx. At page.tsx, you’ll see many styling classes. But when you look at global.css (app/ui/global.css), you see very little styling. The tailwind postcss plugin that’s part of this boilerplate actually extracted/unrolled the full css rules at the tailwind directives above. Explanations are as follows:
- @tailwind base; → Imports Tailwind’s preflight styles (a minimal CSS reset).
- @tailwind components; → Imports any custom component classes defined in @layer components.
- @tailwind utilities; → Imports all utility classes (e.g., flex, text-center, mt-4).

Let’s add an element with tailwind classes to create the Vercel triangle logo. Copy the code below and paste it above the `<p>` element in /app/page.tsx:
```
<div  
  className="relative w-0 h-0 border-l-[15px] border-r-[15px] border-b-[26px] border-l-transparent border-r-transparent border-b-black"  
/>
```

Your web browser should show:

### 2.[2] Clsx

Tailwind classes with React or NextJS can get very messy when you have to mix classes that always apply to a component with classes that are placed in when certain state variables are certain values. It gets even messier if you have several state variables determining multiple classes in a component. For example:
```
<div className={"class1 class2" + (flag1||" class3") + (flag2?" class4":" class5")}
```

clsx is syntactic sugar that makes className easier to glance over and reason with. Firstly, make sure you've installed clsx:
```
pnpm install clsx
```

> [!note] Mnemonic
> Clsx can be remembered as Class eXchange. You'll see why in the next paragraphs as classes can be swapped in and out based on boolean results. No vowels in the name, so: Clsx. It helps to remember the name so you can use it in your code and install it on fresh projects without referencing notes.

Clsx usage consists of base classes (classes that always apply to the component), and then as many class_name: boolean_result key value pairs as you want in an object at the second argument. Only boolean_result’s that are true will add the class name (from the key name). The format is:
```
clsx("base-classes",   
  {  
    "classes-if-": TRUE  
    "classes-if-": TRUE  
  }  
);
```

Eg.
```
    <span  
      className={clsx(  
        'inline-flex items-center rounded-full px-2 py-1 text-sm',  
        {  
          'bg-gray-100 text-gray-500': status === 'pending',  
          'bg-green-500 text-white': status === 'paid',  
        },  
      )}  
    >
```

^ So the component at any point in the app is either:
- `<span className='inline-flex items-center rounded-full px-2 py-1 text-sm bg-gray-100 text-gray-500'>`
- OR `<span className='inline-flex items-center rounded-full px-2 py-1 text-sm bg-green-500 text-white'>`

Let’s add that to `/app/ui/invoices/status.tsx` and make sure to import clsx:
```
import clsx from 'clsx';  
   
export default function InvoiceStatus({ status }: { status: string }) {  
  return (  
    <span  
      className={clsx(  
        'inline-flex items-center rounded-full px-2 py-1 text-sm',  
        {  
          'bg-gray-100 text-gray-500': status === 'pending',  
          'bg-green-500 text-white': status === 'paid',  
        },  
      )}  
    >  
    // ...  
)}
```

^ Explanation of function signature: We destructured `status` from props gets `typed`
- Why Does `{ status }: { status: string }`  Work?
	- First `{ status }` : Destructures status from the props.
	- Second `{ status: string }` : Provides the type annotation in TypeScript.
- Why it can't just simply be `export default function InvoiceStatus({ status: string }) {`?  
	- If you wrote `{ status: string }`, TypeScript would think you're trying to **rename** `status` to `string`, which is not allowed.

At least the above is from the official docs’ instructions, but we’re not at the point to be able to render this component inside of invoices page yet in order to see our work in the web browser.

Let’s work on `app/page.tsx`  because the other pages you need to line up the components etc correctly for them to render (which will be later chapters). At `app/page.tsx` , import the following:
```
import clsx from 'clsx';  
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
```

Before returning JSX, add a timer that switches mode between true and false every second:
```
  const [mode, setMode] = useState(false)  
  
  useEffect(()=>{  
    setTimeout(()=>{  
      setMode(!mode)  
    }, 1000)  
  }, [mode])
```

  
Below `<AcmeLogo/>` , add text that changes tailwind text colors based on if mode is false or true:

```
	<div   
	  className={clsx(  
		"2xl ml-8 mb-2",  
		{  
		  "text-muted": !mode,  
		  "text-red-200": mode  
		}  
	  )}  
>
```

The result is a gray to red flashing text next to the logo!

### 2.[3] Modular CSS
Create `/app/ui/invoices/status.tsx`  with only rules that select for classes (Like .shape):
```
.shape {  
  height: 0;  
  width: 0;  
  border-bottom: 30px solid black;  
  border-left: 20px solid transparent;  
  border-right: 20px solid transparent;  
}
```

Import shape utility classes to be used by using the class selector as a key name:
```
import styles from '@/app/ui/home.module.css';  
...  
<div className={styles.shape} />
```

Discussing CSS Modules:
By having a css file end with “.module.css, then NextJS (among other JS frameworks) will locally scope the css file to that component only and a rule set become pullable using the `style.`  object as long as the rule set is a single class selection. All other rule sets that have mixed selection (or tag selection, id selection, etc) will be ignored by the `style.`  block and there will be no error or warning thrown.

>[!note] NOTE CHANGES FROM OFFICIAL DOCS: 
>Changes made to Chapter 2 that deviate from official documents. 
>- I presented clsx before css modules because it's a smoother transition when tailwind finishes covering, then clsx is next (which is a syntactic sugar for bloating tailwind classes with conditionals). I've named the sections "2.[2]" and "2.[3]" to match the new arbitrary order in my docs.
>- For clsx, I added my own example that you can render because the official docs added an example that you can't even render yet. I also explained why clsx is recommended.

**TO BE CONTINUED:** Being worked on so far in 3/5/25 - Weng.
