Since we’ve been using Fetch for navigation purposes (retrieving pages), we’ll continue on navigation topics. Here we. cover search and pagination leveraging Postgres query to offset row results and limit row results returned.

You will be implementing the Invoice page (`dashboard/invoices/page.tsx`)
![[Pasted image 20250308170824.png]]


At the top is the search component (`ui/search.tsx`)
![[Pasted image 20250308171234.png]]


At the bottom is the pagination controls (`ui/invoices/pagination.tsx`)
- You don't want to display all the invoices on one page because it could be a performance issue and a poor user experience (too much information to shift through on one page), so instead of one fetch, you defer to later fetches (when use clicks the next page)
![[Pasted image 20250308171244.png]]


The three sections (search, table, and pagination) refer to the code at `/dashboard/invoices/page.tsx`:
```
      <div className="mt-4 flex items-center justify-between gap-2 md:mt-8">
        <Search placeholder="Search invoices..." />
        <CreateInvoice />
      </div>
       <Suspense key={query + currentPage} fallback={<InvoicesTableSkeleton />}>
        <Table query={query} currentPage={currentPage} />
      </Suspense>
      <div className="mt-5 flex w-full justify-center">
        <Pagination totalPages={totalPages} />
      </div>
```


With these types of interactions and components, we can cover a lot of topics:
- Fetch triggered by search
- Debounce aka throttle search input triggering fetch
- Fetch split with pagination

**Discussion**

We will leverage Postgres query to offset row results and limit row results returned which gets rendered at `Table`. However, we also need to keep track of what offset we are at so that `Pagination` can highlight the appropriate page number. `Search` will also affect what shows up at `Table` and how many pages of results there will be at `Pagination` through Postgreq query's ILIKE (case insensitive partial search). The query's clauses that specify the offset, limit, and partial search is at `lib/data.ts` at function fetchFilteredInvoices:
```
WHERE
	customers.name ILIKE ${`%${query}%`} OR
	customers.email ILIKE ${`%${query}%`} OR
	invoices.amount::text ILIKE ${`%${query}%`} OR
	invoices.date::text ILIKE ${`%${query}%`} OR
	invoices.status ILIKE ${`%${query}%`}
ORDER BY invoices.date DESC
LIMIT ${ITEMS_PER_PAGE} OFFSET ${offset}
```

Another important point of discussion is that these are three components Search, Table, and Pagination, and they need to have access to the page number and the search query. So there needs to be a central way to store that information and retrieve it. Instead of using global state or context like in React, we simply change and refer to the url query. The url would be `localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices?page=1&query=Michael` for example, and all three components can refer to or change the url.

It's important to know the parts of the URL:
- Path name is the part after the domain, "domain extension" (TLD), and port number: `/dashboard/invoices`
- URL Search parameters, aka url query string is the part that starts with `?` that gives the website's code more information: `?page=1&query=Michael`
- Visit `https://www.google.com/search?q=test` which opens Google Search Engine results to the query test, then go to the DevTools console (CMD+OPT+J):
	- Typing `window.location.pathname` and pressing enter gets you `/search`
	- Typing `window.location.search` and pressing enter gets you `?q=test`
	- And q parameter stands for query or search engine keywords
- For our query we can use ?page= and &query=. Recall that with url search parameters, the first parameter begins with ? and subsequent parameters are chained together in the url search parameters with &.

We will use two NextJS hooks to read from the URL:
- useSearchParams
- usePathname

Then to modify the URL with new search parameters, it's a three step process
- Instantialize URLSearchParams which will expose methods to modify the url:
```
const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
```
- The methods to modify the URL search parameters include:
	- Updating the key/value in the url: `params.set('q', 'test2')`
	- Deleting the key/value in the url: `params.delete('q')`
- Then we use the hook that lets us replace the url:
```
const {replace} = useRouter();
// ...  
replace(`${pathname}?${params.toString()}`);
```

---

Let's implement the above into `ui/search.tsx`:
- We add "use client" to the top to make the component be able to use event listeners and hooks.
- The goal is that whatever the user types into the search component, it'll update the url with the search term.
```
'use client';
 
import { MagnifyingGlassIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import { useSearchParams, usePathname, useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
 
export default function Search({ placeholder }: { placeholder: string }) {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
  const pathname = usePathname();
  const { replace } = useRouter();


  function handleSearch(term: string) {
    console.log(term);  
    
	const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
    if (term) {
      params.set('query', term);
    } else {
      params.delete('query');
    }
    replace(`${pathname}?${params.toString()}`);
  }
 
  return (
    <div className="relative flex flex-1 flex-shrink-0">
      <label htmlFor="search" className="sr-only">
        Search
      </label>
      <input
        className="peer block w-full rounded-md border border-gray-200 py-[9px] pl-10 text-sm outline-2 placeholder:text-gray-500"
        placeholder={placeholder}
        onChange={(e) => {
          handleSearch(e.target.value);
        }}
      />
      <MagnifyingGlassIcon className="absolute left-3 top-1/2 h-[18px] w-[18px] -translate-y-1/2 text-gray-500 peer-focus:text-gray-900" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

But to be able to view the Search component in the browser, note it's rendered by `dashboard/invoices/page.tsx`, so let's take care of that:
```
import Pagination from '@/app/ui/invoices/pagination';
import Search from '@/app/ui/search';
import Table from '@/app/ui/invoices/table';
import { CreateInvoice } from '@/app/ui/invoices/buttons';
import { lusitana } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
import { InvoicesTableSkeleton } from '@/app/ui/skeletons';
import { Suspense } from 'react';
 
export default async function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="w-full">
      <div className="flex w-full items-center justify-between">
        <h1 className={`${lusitana.className} text-2xl`}>Invoices</h1>
      </div>
      <div className="mt-4 flex items-center justify-between gap-2 md:mt-8">
        <Search placeholder="Search invoices..." />
        <CreateInvoice />
      </div>
      {/*  
      <Suspense key={query + currentPage} fallback={<InvoicesTableSkeleton />}>
		  <Table query={query} currentPage={currentPage} />
      </Suspense> 
      */}
      <div className="mt-5 flex w-full justify-center">
        {/* <Pagination totalPages={totalPages} /> */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

^ We'll leave the Table and Pagination commented out for now so we can focus on Search, because those requires dealing with reading the page number and query from the URL. We are currently focused on writing to the URL based on what's searched.

Test this by visiting `localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices` then typing `Mich`. You should see the URL changing as you type:
![[Pasted image 20250308185213.png]]

But let's do the converse: Visit `localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices/?query=Michael`
Search will be blank:
![[Pasted image 20250308185311.png]]

We don't want that because we may want to share filtered/searched pages to coworkers. So we set the default value to the url search parameter `query` if it exists, otherwise sets to undefined, which is fine. Add this to `input`:
```
defaultValue={searchParams.get('query')?.toString()}
```

Now if you visit `localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices/?query=Michael`, the search should be prefilled with "MIchael".

We will implement the Table which shows invoices with the partial search (and if not searched, shows all invoices)

Page components [accept a prop called `searchParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page), so you can pass the current URL params to the `<Table>` component. The Search component was rendered by Page but we did not pass the searchParams prop, and that's why the Search component had to use the hook `useSearchParams` to access the URL.

Let's modify page.tsx:
```
import Pagination from '@/app/ui/invoices/pagination';
import Search from '@/app/ui/search';
import Table from '@/app/ui/invoices/table';
import { CreateInvoice } from '@/app/ui/invoices/buttons';
import { lusitana } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import { InvoicesTableSkeleton } from '@/app/ui/skeletons';
 
export default async function Page(props: {
  searchParams?: Promise<{
    query?: string;
    page?: string;
  }>;
}) {
  const searchParams = await props.searchParams;
  const query = searchParams?.query || '';
  const currentPage = Number(searchParams?.page) || 1;
 
  return (
    <div className="w-full">
      <div className="flex w-full items-center justify-between">
        <h1 className={`${lusitana.className} text-2xl`}>Invoices</h1>
      </div>
      <div className="mt-4 flex items-center justify-between gap-2 md:mt-8">
        <Search placeholder="Search invoices..." />
        <CreateInvoice />
      </div>
      <Suspense key={query + currentPage} fallback={<InvoicesTableSkeleton />}>
        <Table query={query} currentPage={currentPage} />
      </Suspense>
      <div className="mt-5 flex w-full justify-center">
        {/* <Pagination totalPages={totalPages} /> */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

^ Btw: By having a key at a component Suspense, we can force re-mount and re-fetch whenever the query changes.

Viewing localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices:
![[Pasted image 20250308190641.png]]

And typing into search: "Mich":
![[Pasted image 20250308190704.png]]

As you were typing "Mich", that's 4 fetches. This is not a problem in a small app with one user, but it'll be a problem when scaled up. So the practice is to throttle new fetches to at least 300ms in what is also called debouncing. Let's implement this before continuing onto Pagination.

1. Install debouncing package:
	```
	pnpm i use-debounce
	```

2. Pass the old handleSearch function into a useDebouncedCallback so that it will call for you if the time is correct (not within 300ms). Modifying `/ui/search.tsx`:
```
// ...
import { useDebouncedCallback } from 'use-debounce';
 
// Inside the Search Component...
const handleSearch = useDebouncedCallback((term) => {
  console.log(`Searching... ${term}`);
 
  const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
  if (term) {
    params.set('query', term);
  } else {
    params.delete('query');
  }
  replace(`${pathname}?${params.toString()}`);
}, 300);
```

---

Finally, let's move onto pagination. 

Pagination component needs to know the total number of pages so it knows when to stop rendering page numbers that can be clicked:
![[Pasted image 20250308171244.png]]

At `lib/data.ts` is fetchInvoicesPage which queries the database for `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices...` returning the total number of invoices (but not returning all the invoice information at once, because we will be having multiple fetches per page, offsetting and limiting the results instead)

Re-include the Pagination component and pass it the total number of invoices at `dashboard/invoices/page.tsx`: (three lines added):
```
// ...
import { fetchInvoicesPages } from '@/app/lib/data';
 
export default async function Page(
  props: {
    searchParams?: Promise<{
      query?: string;
      page?: string;
    }>;
  }
) {
  const searchParams = await props.searchParams;
  const query = searchParams?.query || '';
  const currentPage = Number(searchParams?.page) || 1;
  const totalPages = await fetchInvoicesPages(query);
 
  return (
    // ...
      <div className="mt-5 flex w-full justify-center">
        <Pagination totalPages={totalPages} />
      </div>
  );
}
```

View the page, you can click the other page numbers that aren't highlighted to see the table in action.

As a **side effect** we need to address: We should reset page number to 1 every time we search a new person's name. Let's say you've clicked page 2. Then you go searching another name. The Pagination component continues highligting page 2 because the URL still has page 2. That doesn't make sense because on a new search, you want to see the first results on page 1. So at `search.tsx`, reset the page number in the url before replacing it, once handleSearch is triggered (added one line):
```
  const handleSearch = useDebouncedCallback((term) => {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams);
    params.set('page', '1');
    if (term) {
      params.set('query', term);
    } else {
      params.delete('query');
    }
    replace(`${pathname}?${params.toString()}`);
  }, 300);
```

The Invoice page is fully implemented now (`dashboard/invoices/page.tsx`) (`localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices`):
