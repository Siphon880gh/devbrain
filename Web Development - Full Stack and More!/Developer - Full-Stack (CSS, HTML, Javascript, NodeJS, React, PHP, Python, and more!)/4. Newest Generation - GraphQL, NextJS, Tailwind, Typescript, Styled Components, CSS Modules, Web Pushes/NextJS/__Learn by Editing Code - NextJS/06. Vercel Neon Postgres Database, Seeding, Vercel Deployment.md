We will have make the app full-stack locally and online, connecting to a database.

The official docs instructed to deploy to Vercel, then create a database at Vercel, then sees that database from local development (because it connects to the remote database). This approach doesn't make sense because you want to do everything locally first when building your app and seeding because if there are any errors locally, there likely will be errors when deploying when it builds and starts the app. And getting errors when deploying is harder to debug. So I reordered the steps to: create database, seed database, build and start production locally, then finally deploy at Vercel. Hence I named the section numbers with "arbitrary values" square brackets.

Vercel is known for hosting websites and apps, but it also has databases. Let’s use their databases first.

Signup for vercel.com if you don’t have an account. You can OAuth2 with your Github account.

Visit [https://vercel.com/YOUR_NAME-projects/~/stores](https://vercel.com/weng-fei-fungs-projects/~/stores) or click Storage tab:
![[Pasted image 20250307001340.png]]

Choose Neon Serverless Postgres (Official docs as of 3/2025 is using the old Postgres which is not NEON, however that has been sunsetted):
![[Pasted image 20250307001349.png]]

Choose geography and plan (there's free):
![[Pasted image 20250307001442.png]]


Note it tells you the database name (Here it is "wayne-teaches-code"). Note there are code generation on connecting to libraries like Prisma and code generation for an .env.local file:
![[Pasted image 20250307001725.png]]

Click the ".env.local" tab and copy the contents to your local development .env:
![[Pasted image 20250307002038.png]]

Visit [http://localhost:3000/seed](http://localhost:3000/seed) to seed the online database (since the .env file connects to Vercel-Neon's PostgreSQL database):

**Checkpoint - If you get bcrypt is missing error**

Refer to: [[ Troubleshooting - bcrypt MODULE_NOT_FOUND]]

Once seeded, you can confirm that the online database has been filled by going back to Vercel database.

Click "Open in Neon" (secondary button next to "Connect Project")
![[Pasted image 20250307001725.png]]

And you open Tables on the left sidebar to see tables and filled rows:

Once we confirmed we can build locally, then we can deploy to Vercel which will run build script, and this approach would lead to less Vercel errors.

Push a NextJS repo to your Github, connect your Github to your Vercel, then at the import in menu → select the github repo.

If you’re using their NextJS’ example, it is already git initiated though doesn’t have an origin remote - you have to add the origin with: `git remote add origin YOUR_BLANK_GITHUB_REPO_URL` 

Then push it up `git push origin main` 

[https://vercel.com/YOUR_NAME_-projects](https://vercel.com/weng-fei-fungs-projects)  

Click "Import Project" at:
![[Pasted image 20250307003020.png]]

You may need to authorize Github into Vercel if not yet (You click Install - this is not a computer app, but it's really "installing permissions"):

Before hitting "Deploy", we need to adjust some settings.

- Root for deploying:
  Setting the Root Directory for Vercel
  When importing a project to Vercel, it asks for the "Root Directory." This should be:
	- If your Next.js app is in the project root (where package.json is), leave the root directory as /.
	- If your Next.js app is inside a subfolder (e.g., your-app/), set the root directory to that folder.
- Environmental variables:
  ![[Pasted image 20250307003247.png]]
  The same env variables from your local .env that built successfully needs to be copied over. It's a lot to copy but there's a shortcut
  
  Paste all the contents of your .env file into a key textfield and it’ll prefill all the key-values for you:

  Prefills:

Now hit deploy.
