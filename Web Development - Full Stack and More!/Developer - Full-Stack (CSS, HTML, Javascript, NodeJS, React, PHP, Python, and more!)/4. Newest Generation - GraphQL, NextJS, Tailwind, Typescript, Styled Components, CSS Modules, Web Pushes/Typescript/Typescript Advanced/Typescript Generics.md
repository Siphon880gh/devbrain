Generics provide a way to create reusable components that work over a variety of types rather than a single one. This adds flexibility and type-safety to functions, classes, interfaces, and types.

**Example of Generics:**

```typescript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
    return arg;
}

let output1 = identity<string>("myString");
let output2 = identity<number>(123);
```

Here, `identity` is a generic function. The type parameter `<T>` allows it to operate over variables of any type, while still maintaining the type information.

These features are fundamental in developing robust, maintainable, and reusable TypeScript applications by providing enhanced control over how types interact and transform in your code.
