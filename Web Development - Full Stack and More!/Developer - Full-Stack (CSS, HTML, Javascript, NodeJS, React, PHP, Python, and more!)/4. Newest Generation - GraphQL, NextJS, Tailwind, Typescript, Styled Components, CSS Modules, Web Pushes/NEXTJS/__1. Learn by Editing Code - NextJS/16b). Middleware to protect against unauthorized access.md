>The official docs have Chapter 14 for Accessibility, Chapter 15 for Authentication, and Chapter 16 for Meta tag, which is a strange order. For our docs, we have Chapter 14 and (15) for Accessibility and Meta tag; And, Chapter (16) will be for Authentication (including Middleware to protect pages) which is a more advanced topic.

>[!note] Official docs differences
>The official docs ([https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/adding-authentication](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/adding-authentication)) will have you work on old code from previous challenges then add login page and protect dashboard routes to authenticated users only using middleware. However, it doesn’t go into details on the why it works. It also skips out on the sign up page. My lesson will start from a blank project (but using the same database), so you can get a detailed undistracted look at how authentication works.

>Protecting pages with middleware is a separate lesson 16b. so that you get the basics of authentication without intertwining it with middleware.

This is a continuation of coding work from [[16a). Authentication]].

Visit the logged in Success page directly in incognito (cookies cleared):
[http://localhost:3000/success](http://localhost:3000/success)

![[Pasted image 20250310170903.png]]

Unfortunately, you can view the page. This is certainly not expected because only logged in users should see this page. We will fix that.

We will setup middleware that runs when a url matches a pattern and before sending the full page to the user. The middleware will check if the user is logged in, and if not logged in, redirects the user back to the login page.
## Setting Up Middleware

1. Defining Authentication Configuration
   **Modify** **`src/auth.config.ts`** file:
	- This config file is used by auth.ts and will be used by middleware.ts (which we will define in the next step)
	- This configuration is also used by `auth.ts`  to set a custom login page to be redirected to.
		- If you directly visit an unauthorized protected page (like the success confirmation page at `localhost:3000/success` ), you’ll be redirected to the custom login page (In this code snippet:  `/login)` - once we implement `middleware.ts`  to take advantage of this configuration (next step)
		- If you don’t set `signIn: '/login'` , the redirection will be to a default NextAuth.js sign-in page.
		```
		import type { NextAuthConfig } from 'next-auth';  
		  
		export const authConfig = {  
		  pages: {  
		    signIn: '/login',  
		  },  
		  callbacks: {  
		    authorized({ auth, request: { nextUrl } }) {  
		      const isLoggedIn = !!auth?.user;  
		      const isOnSuccessPage = nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/success');  
		  
		      if (isOnSuccessPage) return isLoggedIn;  
		      if (isLoggedIn) return Response.redirect(new URL('/success', nextUrl));  
		  
		      return true;  
		    },  
		  },  
		  providers: [],  
		} satisfies NextAuthConfig;
		```

  

2. Create **`src/middleware.ts`**:
	- NextJS automatically detects `src/middleware.ts` 
	- You can only have one middleware.ts per project. It’s **not** like layout.tsx where you can place at a particular path position to apply to that route and other routes from that path position onwards.
	- The middleware.ts can only have ONE export default. Here, NextAuth generates the middleware function for the export default using configuration from `auth.config.ts` . You could define non-default functions that get called at the export default function to separate different middleware logic. The naming convention for `auth.config.ts`  is such that this file is a config file for all things authentication (in fact, `auth.config.ts`  is referred to by `auth.ts`  and `middleware.ts` ) 
	- The middleware.ts has a `config.matcher`  that is exported for NextJS to match the URL that the user hits. If the URL has been hit, then the export default middleware function is called.
	- This prevents unauthorized users from accessing the dashboard.
	- Middleware **blocks rendering** until authentication is verified.
	```
	import NextAuth from 'next-auth';  
	import { authConfig } from './auth.config';  
	  
	export default NextAuth(authConfig).auth;  
	  
	export const config = {  
	  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|.*\\.png$).*)'],  
	};
	```

At incognito, test that visiting success page will kick you back out to Login:
http://localhost:3000/success
