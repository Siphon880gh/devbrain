## Chapter 3 Fonts and Images (Optimized)

This is a retelling of [https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/optimizing-fonts-images](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/optimizing-fonts-images) but with more details.

### 3.1 Fonts

NextJS retrieves font files during the build process and serves them alongside your static assets. This eliminates additional network requests for fonts when users visit your Next.js application, improving performance and preventing layout shifts that could negatively impact SEO scores (Google evaluates the metric "Cumulative Layout Shift").  

NextJS allows you to fetch and download a Google Font during build time by importing the font from “next/font/google”. However, you wouldn’t want to do this for every page because it would cause redundant downloads during build time. So as a best practice, we only import the font once, at a separate module called font.ts, then this module is what provides the fonts to pages or layouts.

Create a file `/app/ui/font.ts`  (Notice it’s ts and not tsx because we do not need JSX in this file):
```
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';  
  
export const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });
```

^ Notice that `font.ts`  does not export the Inter font as a default export. We will have this `font.ts` file export more than one font at a later step. By not having a default export, you have to destructure while importing from `font.ts` at other layouts/pages.

Let’s start using this import. At ``/app/layout.tsx`:``
```
import { inter } from '@/app/ui/fonts';  
//...  
 <body className={`${inter.className} antialiased`}>{children}</body>
```

Design wise, the practice is to have at least 2 fonts on the website (aka font pairs, aka primary font and secondary font). A good font that works with Inter is Lusitana. 

Challenge (Obligated):
At `fonts.ts` , import then export the font `Lusitana` . Then at `/app/page.tsx` , use that font for the `<p>` element. Add tailwind class for bolding `font-bold`  to that element as well

Answer:
If you see a different styled font when viewing on the web browser, then you're correct. Or reveal code answer at [https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/optimizing-fonts-images

### 3.2 Images

Similar to fonts, NextJS serves the images as static assets (as long as they're already files in /public instead of url to an external image) to eliminate additional network requests when user views the website, and also to prevent layout shifts that could negatively impact SEO scores (Again, Google evaluates the metric "Cumulative Layout Shift").

In addition, we define image dimensions properly in HTML or CSS, so that the browser will not resize the page dynamically and cause elements to shift, affecting the "Cumulative Layout Shift" score.

At `/app/page.tsx`, use NextJS's Image component to add `/hero-desktop.png` at `{/* Add Hero Images Here */}`:
```
import Image from 'next/image';
// ...
<Image src="/hero-desktop.png" width={1000} height={760} className="hidden md:block" alt="Screenshots of the dashboard project showing desktop version" />
```


Challenge (Obligated):
At the same page, add a `hero-mobile.png` with the width 560px and height 620px. 

Have the `hero-desktop.png` shown on Desktop and `/hero-mobile.png` shown on Mobile, otherwise hidden.
- Hint: Use tailwind. Remember tailwind is responsive first. You can have an element hidden unless md and upwards. Responsive classes include `md:text-red-400` which makes the text red at md sized screen; and if it's an element with that one class, smaller screens since they're missing styling classes will not be red or even styled.

Answer:
On Desktop, see the webpage on a maximized web browser window. Then resize the window width down to about phone size. You should see the desktop version of the image first, the the mobile version of the image should appear in its place when you made the window almost the same size as a phone.
