Fixed her group's file uploading. Her group is using express-fileupload. For production server, we made sure to create a build/ by running npm run build, we made sure that static settings is pointing to build/ and made sure the upload route points to build/uploads folder, making sure the upload route receives the fetch body which has the file data, then save that file data to the client/build/uploads from from express.js. Henceforth, the file can be accessed from React side too (eg. displaying uploaded image). For development/HMR server, we changed React's axios into a fetch that sends formData (of the uploading File) in case axios doesn't work with proxying, added a proxy to 3001 at client package.json so that the HMR server will do relative fetches to the express server.js, however ran out of time to test if that worked (Should work because we also fixed a typo at the upload route); she is happy the file upload works in production and later will test if the development/proxy file upload works too.

Got it! If you're using React and the `express-fileupload` middleware in your Express backend to handle file uploads from a form, here's a general outline of how you can set it up:

1. Install the necessary dependencies:
   - In your React project, you'll need to install a form library (e.g., `react-hook-form`, `formik`, or `react-final-form`) to handle form submission.
   - In your Express backend, install `express-fileupload` using npm or yarn: `npm install express-fileupload` or `yarn add express-fileupload`.

2. Create your React form component:
   - Import the necessary components from your chosen form library.
   - Set up your form with appropriate input fields, including a file input field.
   - Handle form submission and send the data to your Express backend.

3. Set up file upload handling in your Express backend:
   - Import the `express-fileupload` middleware in your server file.
   - Add the middleware to your Express app: `app.use(fileUpload())`.
   - Configure any desired options for file upload (e.g., file size limits, file types).
   - Handle the file upload in your route handler:
     - Access the uploaded file using `req.files`.
     - Process the file as needed (e.g., save it to a specific location, perform validations, etc.).
     - Send a response back to the client with the appropriate information (e.g., success message, error message).

4. Test your file upload functionality:
   - Start your React development server and your Express backend server.
   - Submit the form with a file selected to trigger the file upload.
   - Verify that the file is successfully uploaded and processed on the server.
   - Handle any errors or edge cases that may arise.

Please note that this is a general guide, and the exact implementation may vary depending on your specific setup and requirements. Make sure to consult the documentation of `express-fileupload` and your chosen form library for more detailed instructions and examples.

To upload a file using `fetch` in React with the `express-fileupload` middleware in your Express backend, you can follow these steps:

1. In your React component, create a function to handle the file upload. This function will make a POST request to your backend.

```javascript
const handleFileUpload = async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();

  const fileInput = event.target.files[0];

  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', fileInput);

  try {
    const response = await fetch('/upload', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: formData,
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      console.log('File uploaded successfully!');
      // Handle successful response
    } else {
      console.error('File upload failed.');
      // Handle failed response
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error uploading file:', error);
    // Handle error
  }
};
```

2. In your Express backend, set up a route to handle the file upload.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const fileUpload = require('express-fileupload');

const app = express();

app.use(fileUpload());

app.post('/upload', (req, res) => {
  if (!req.files || Object.keys(req.files).length === 0) {
    return res.status(400).send('No files were uploaded.');
  }

  // Access the uploaded file
  const uploadedFile = req.files.file;

  // Process the file as needed
  // For example, save it to a specific location
  uploadedFile.mv('path/to/save/file', (error) => {
    if (error) {
      console.error('Error saving file:', error);
      return res.status(500).send('Error saving file.');
    }

    // File saved successfully
    res.send('File uploaded!');
  });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

3. Ensure that your Express server is running, and then use the `handleFileUpload` function in your React component to trigger the file upload when a file is selected in the file input field.

```javascript
<input type="file" onChange={handleFileUpload} />
```

Make sure to adjust the route and file paths according to your specific needs. Also, consider adding appropriate error handling and validation based on your requirements.

Remember to install the required dependencies in your Express backend by running `npm install express-fileupload`, and import the necessary modules in your server file.

This implementation assumes that both your React frontend and Express backend are running on the same domain. If they are running on different domains, you may need to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in your Express server.
