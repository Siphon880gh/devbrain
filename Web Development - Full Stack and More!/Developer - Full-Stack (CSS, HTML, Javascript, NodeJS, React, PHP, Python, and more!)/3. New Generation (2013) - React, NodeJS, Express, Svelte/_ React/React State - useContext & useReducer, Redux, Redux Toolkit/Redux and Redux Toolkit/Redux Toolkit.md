Sure, I'll convert the given Redux tutorial to use Redux Toolkit, which simplifies many aspects of using Redux in your applications.

### Introduction to Redux Toolkit

Redux Toolkit provides a set of tools that facilitate Redux development by reducing boilerplate code and simplifying common tasks. It is the recommended approach for writing Redux logic.

### Setting Up Redux Toolkit in a React App

Let's adapt the provided Redux setup to use Redux Toolkit. This includes installing Redux Toolkit, creating a store with `configureStore`, and using slices to encapsulate reducers and actions.

#### 1. Installing Redux Toolkit

First, install Redux Toolkit alongside React-Redux:

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

#### 2. Creating a Redux Store with `configureStore`

Redux Toolkit's `configureStore` function simplifies store creation and automatically sets up the Redux DevTools extension.

```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    // Here you will add your reducers
  },
});
```

#### 3. Creating Slices

A "slice" is a collection of reducer logic and actions for a single feature in your app. `createSlice` automatically generates action creators and action types.

For example, let's refactor the counter logic into a slice:

```javascript
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: {
    count: 0,
  },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.count += 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.count -= 1;
    },
  },
});

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

Then, include this reducer in your store:

```javascript
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterSlice.reducer,
  },
});
```

#### 4. Using `useSelector` and `useDispatch` with Redux Toolkit

Using `useSelector` and `useDispatch` remains the same, but now you'll use the action creators generated by the slice:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { increment, decrement } from './counterSlice';

const Counter = () => {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.count);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Counter: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

#### 5. Updating the App Component

Integrate the `Provider` as before, ensuring the Redux store is accessible throughout your application:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './store';
import Counter from './Counter';

const App = () => (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Redux Toolkit Counter Example!</h1>
      <Counter />
    </div>
  </Provider>
);

export default App;
```

### Conclusion

Redux Toolkit streamlines Redux development by reducing boilerplate and simplifying the process of defining reducers and actions. This updated tutorial demonstrates how to leverage Redux Toolkit in a React application, enhancing the maintainability and scalability of your state management logic.
