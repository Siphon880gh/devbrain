const Component = () => {
  const audioRef = useRef<ElementRef<"audio">>(null);

  return <audio ref={audioRef}>Hello</audio>;
};
```

Defines a React component that uses a useRef hook to create a reference to an HTML audio element.

Using a reference to an HTML audio element in React can be useful for several reasons, especially when you want to control the playback programmatically. Here are some use cases:

1. **Play and Pause Control**: You can use the reference to play or pause the audio from other parts of your component, such as in response to button clicks or other user interactions.

2. **Volume Control**: The reference allows you to adjust the volume or mute the audio dynamically based on user input or other application events.

3. **Seeking**: You can use the ref to implement a seek bar, allowing users to jump to different parts of the audio.

4. **Autoplay Control**: Although not recommended due to user experience and browser restrictions, you could use the ref to programmatically start the audio when certain conditions are met.

5. **Getting Duration and Playback State**: The reference can be used to get information about the audio, such as its duration, current time, and whether it's paused or playing.

6. **Event Handling**: You can add event listeners to the audio element for events like `onEnded`, `onLoadedMetadata`, and `onTimeUpdate` to handle scenarios like playing the next track in a playlist, displaying duration, or updating a custom seek bar.

7. **Integration with Web Audio API**: For more advanced audio processing and visualization, you can use the ref to integrate with the Web Audio API.

8. **Preloading Audio**: By changing the `preload` attribute programmatically, you can control how much of the audio is downloaded before playback begins.

9. **Synchronization with Other Media**: If you're dealing with multiple media types, such as audio and video, you can synchronize them by using refs to control their playback times.

10. **Custom Controls**: When creating a custom audio player with its own set of controls, using refs is essential to interact with the audio element without relying on the default browser controls.

11. **Accessibility Enhancements**: You can use the ref to make the audio element work better with screen readers or to provide custom audio descriptions for visually impaired users.

These are just a few examples, and the actual use cases may vary depending on the needs of your application and the creativity of your implementation.


Discussion:

Con: Please explain why `useRef<ElementRef<"audio">>()` is better than `useRef<HTMLAudioElement>()`. My IDE autocompletes the latter, the code is cleaner, it is less abstract, and not proprietary.
Con: What I don't know is why on earth someone would ever hype <ElementRef<"audio">>. If you can't be bothered to become aware of native element types (e.g. HTMLAudioElement) and use autocomplete, then why are you even writing TS? This is peak frontend complexity mercantilism. Buyers beware
