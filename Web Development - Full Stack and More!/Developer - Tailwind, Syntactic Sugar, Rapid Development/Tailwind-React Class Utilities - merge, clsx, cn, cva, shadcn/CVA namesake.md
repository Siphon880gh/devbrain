You install with `npm install class-variance-authority`.

CVA allows you to define a component that can be passed variant options to intialize different variants of the components. For example, you can pass `{size:"sm"}` as a prop, then a button with the tailwind classes for small text, small dimensions, etc will be rendered.

CVA is a play of marvelâ€™s TVA. Even logo is similar, focused on "variants" or versions.
