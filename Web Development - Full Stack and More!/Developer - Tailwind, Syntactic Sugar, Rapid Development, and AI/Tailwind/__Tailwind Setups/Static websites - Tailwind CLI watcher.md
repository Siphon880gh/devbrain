This tutorial is a more detailed form of the official guide on using postcss:
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/tailwind-cli

---

If haven't installed yet, install tailwindcss engine and tailwind cli tool:
```
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/cli
```

Sneak peak: We will run a command that start a watcher that continually watches your HTML files for new tailwind classes, the regenerate the css file with the tailwind class rules.

Tailwind CSS CLI reads `tailwind.config.js` to determine which files to scan for Tailwind classes when generating the final CSS. Specifically, it looks at the `content` key in your configuration file.

tailwind.config.js:
```
module.exports = {  
  content: [  
    "./src/**/*.html",  
    "./src/**/*.js",  
  ],  
  theme: {  
    extend: {},  
  },  
  plugins: [],  
};
```

The css is expanded into styles.css. Therefore, index.html needs to reference destination target style.css (NOT index.css)
```
<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
```


While developing, have tailwindcss cli running, maybe in another terminal.
```
npx tailwindcss -i ./public/index.css -o ./public/styles.css --watch
```

6. Start using Tailwind in your HTML
You can insert this at the `<body>`:
```
<h1 class="text-4xl text-orange-400">Title</h1>
```

7. You can right click in VS Code -> Open Live Server (Also notice a `styles.css` got generated by the npm script's command):

8. You will see instant changes on the web browser page, as you're changing tailwind classes in your HTML code because you've started a Live Server that performs hot reload:
