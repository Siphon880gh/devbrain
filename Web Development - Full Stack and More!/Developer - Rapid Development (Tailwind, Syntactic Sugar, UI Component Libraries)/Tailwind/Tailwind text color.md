Here's a reference for common text color utilities in Tailwind CSS:

### Basic Text Colors
```css
text-black
text-white
text-gray-500
text-red-500
text-yellow-500
text-green-500
text-blue-500
text-indigo-500
text-purple-500
text-pink-500
```

### Extended Shades (Example: Gray)
Tailwind includes a range of shades for each color. Hereâ€™s an example with gray:

```css
text-gray-50
text-gray-100
text-gray-200
text-gray-300
text-gray-400
text-gray-500
text-gray-600
text-gray-700
text-gray-800
text-gray-900
```

### Other Colors
Similar shades are available for other colors too. Just replace "gray" with any color name:

- **Red**: `text-red-50` to `text-red-900`
- **Yellow**: `text-yellow-50` to `text-yellow-900`
- **Green**: `text-green-50` to `text-green-900`
- **Blue**: `text-blue-50` to `text-blue-900`
- **Indigo**: `text-indigo-50` to `text-indigo-900`
- **Purple**: `text-purple-50` to `text-purple-900`
- **Pink**: `text-pink-50` to `text-pink-900`

### Opacity
You can adjust text opacity with additional classes:

```css
text-opacity-0
text-opacity-25
text-opacity-50
text-opacity-75
text-opacity-100
```

This provides you with control over both color and transparency for text. You can also customize colors in your Tailwind configuration file if you need specific shades beyond the defaults.
