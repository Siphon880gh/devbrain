To set an element to half the width of its parent container in Tailwind CSS, you can use the width utility class `w-1/2`. This class sets the element's width to 50% of its parent. Here's how you would apply it to an input element:

  

```html

<input class="w-1/2" type="text" placeholder="Half width input">

```

  

In this example, `w-1/2` is the class that applies the 50% width. When you use this class, the input will take up half the width of its parent container. You can combine this with other utility classes to style the input further, such as padding, borders, and colors.
