That's the basic websites where you have like:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <script src="assets/script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

âœ… Custom HTML Webpages
These are the classic example of static websites:
- You write HTML, CSS, and maybe JavaScript by hand.
- The content is fixed until you manually change the code or files.
- When a user visits, they just get those exact files.
