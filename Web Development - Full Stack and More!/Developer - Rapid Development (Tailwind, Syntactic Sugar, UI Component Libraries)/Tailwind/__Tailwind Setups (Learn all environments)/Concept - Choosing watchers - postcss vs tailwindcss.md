Note difference between [[Tailwind v4 - npm tailwindcss watcher]] and [[Tailwind v4 - npm postcss watcher]]

tailwindcss is simple. you run a npm script that will have tailwindcss scan your html files, then create a destination css file that only uses the css rules needed for the tailwind classes matched in the html files.

postcss is superior because it includes tailwindcss and also **autoprefixer**. So not only does it perform like tailwindcss (scanning html files for tailwind classes, then creating a destination css file like styles.css that only includes the needed css rules) - it also can perform autoprefixing (adding moz- and related vendor fixes so that css rules work on older web browsers). And with postcss, you can add other plugins that transform the css in other ways (eg. uglification/minification). however, postcss is a lot of steps and is more complex.

Reworded postcss:
Then postcss command allows you to chain tailwindcss AND autoprefixer so it can handle backward compatibility by adding moz- and other related vendor prefixes. Postcss allows tailwindcss and autoprefixer to run CSS transformations into a target css file. So instead of only running one transformation tool - the tailwind css cli - you can run different kinds to sequentially create the target css file.
