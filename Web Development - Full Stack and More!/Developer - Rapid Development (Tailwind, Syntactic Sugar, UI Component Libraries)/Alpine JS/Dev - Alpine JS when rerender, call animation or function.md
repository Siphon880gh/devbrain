Can x-show trigger a function call?

\>>
In Alpine.js, the `x-show` directive is specifically designed for conditional rendering, i.e., showing or hiding an element based on the truthiness of an expression. It does not inherently trigger a function call when an element is shown or hidden.

However, if you want to execute a function when an element's visibility changes, you can do so indirectly by tying the function call to the same reactive state that `x-show` uses. For example, you can use a watcher or execute a function within methods that change the state used by `x-show`.

Here's a modified example of the previous SPA where a function is called when the page changes:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>SPA with Function Calls on Visibility Change</title>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@2.x/dist/alpine.min.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>

<div x-data="spaController()">
<div x-show="page === 1">Page 1 Content</div>
<div x-show="page === 2">Page 2 Content</div>
<div x-show="page === 3">Page 3 Content</div>

<button x-on:click="changePage(-1)">Previous Page</button>
<button x-on:click="changePage(1)">Next Page</button>

<p>Current Page: <span x-text="page"></span></p>
</div>

<script>
function spaController() {
return {
page: 1,
changePage(direction) {
let newPage = this.page + direction;
if (newPage >= 1 && newPage <= 3) {
this.page = newPage;
this.onPageChange();
}
},
onPageChange() {
console.log("Page changed to: " + this.page);
// Additional actions when the page changes
}
}
}
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

In this version:

- The `changePage` method is used to change the page, ensuring that the page number remains within valid bounds.
- Whenever the page changes, `changePage` calls `onPageChange`, where you can place the code that should be executed when the page changes.
- The `x-on:click` directives on the buttons call `changePage` with either `-1` (previous page) or `1` (next page) as an argument.

This approach allows you to perform actions in response to changes in the state that `x-show` depends on, without directly tying function calls to the `x-show` directive itself.
