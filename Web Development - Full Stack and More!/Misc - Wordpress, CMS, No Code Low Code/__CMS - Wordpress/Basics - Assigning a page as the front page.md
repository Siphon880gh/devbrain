For example, you want a page to be the default page that loads when someone visits domain.com/ without any path after the domain and tld.

Note that whatever Page has "Front Page" designation is that default front page. Here, you see "Welcome" page is it:

To change the front page, go to Appearance -> Customize

Then go to "Homepage Settings":

Select your page at the "Homepage" dropdown:

Click Polish at the top right of that sidebar:

Then test the new page applied by visiting your website. If you don't see it applied, try purging the cache (is there an option at the top strip bar of an authenticated wordpress admin session? or try adding `?nocache=1` at the end of the url in the address bar then pressing Enter to visit the cache-busting url).

You can also test by visiting Pages list to see that the "Front Page" designation has been moved to your desired page.
