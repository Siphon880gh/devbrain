**Salient?**
Salient theme has a couple site builders and site building features
- Salient site builder (Frontend button) but it's locked into their own system. 
- WP Bakery that they bundled in is enhanced and doesn't lock you into their own system. 
- Nectar shortcodes button that opens a library of elements and layouts, then selecting a nectar shortcode opens a wizard of options to configure, and when finalized, inserts a shortcode. This is accessible in the Backend Editor of the enhanced WP Bakery

To compare with other site builders, see: [[Wordpress Site Builders]]

**Where are we:**
You're editing a page because you went from the left sidebar Pages -> Editing a specific page

You can switch between Classic Editor, Backend Editor, and Frontend Editor. Between Classic Editor and Backend Editor, you click the toggle mode button (first button). Frontend editor is the second button. All these editors are enhanced versions of WPBakery Page Builder which the Salient theme bundles in and uses as its site builder. For explanations of Backend and Classic Mode, refer to [[WPBakery Page Builder - _PRIMER - Backend, Classic, Frontend, Visual, Text]]
