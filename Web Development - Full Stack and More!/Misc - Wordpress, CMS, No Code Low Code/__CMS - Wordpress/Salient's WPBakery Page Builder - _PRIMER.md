**Salient?**
Salient theme has a couple site builders and site building features
- Salient site builder (Frontend button) but it's locked into their own system. 
- WP Bakery that they bundled in is enhanced and doesn't lock you into their own system. 
- Nectar shortcodes button that opens a library of elements and layouts, then selecting a nectar shortcode opens a wizard of options to configure, and when finalized, inserts a shortcode. This is accessible in the Backend Editor of the enhanced WP Bakery

To compare with other site builders, see: [[Wordpress Site Builders]]

## Adding on Backend Editor

WPBakery lets you add Elements by pressing "+" and also lets you add previously designed Templates (a predesigned row of elements from either Salient's collection of templates at "Salient Templates" or your collection of templates at "My Templates"). You click either Template collection to look for a row that the Salient team or you designed that you want to add at the current page. The "+" and "My Templates" are WPBakery features, but "Salient Templates" is Salient's touch of enhancing WPBakery.

Note: Although "Salient Templates" and "My Templates" look like a toggle group button where one button is mutually exclusive to the other buttons and by the user clicking it, it switches on which types of elements the "+" add button allows you to add - that is not the case here. While the design is confusing, Salient meant to say that the Plus and the "Salient Templates" are all Salient's designs and the main actions (two main actions), and that's why they're bordered blue.

To save your own row as a template for the "My Templates" collection, refer to [[WPBakery Page Builder - Save my own templates]]

You can also predesign elements that you can add from a collection later. Recall that elements are the individual items inside a row

**Where are we:**
You're editing a page because you went from the left sidebar Pages -> Editing a specific page

You can switch between Classic Editor, Backend Editor, and Frontend Editor. Between Classic Editor and Backend Editor, you click the toggle mode button (first button). Frontend editor is the second button. All these editors are enhanced versions of WPBakery Page Builder which the Salient theme bundles in and uses as its site builder. For explanations of Backend and Classic Mode, refer to [[WPBakery Page Builder - _PRIMER - Backend, Classic, Frontend, Visual, Text]]
