**Are you where you're at>**
For templates (predesigned row of elements), this is the page.
For rows (predesigned row or column inside a row), refer to: [[WPBakery Page Builder - Save my own elements]].

You can also predesign elements that you can add from a collection later. Recall that elements are the individual items inside a row


To save your own row as a template for the "My Templates" collection:

Edit the row:

Go for Row settings (top right gear) at the Row Settings modal for the option to save as a template (Will go under "My Templates")!

To use your templates:

WPBakery lets you add Elements by pressing "+" and also lets you add previously designed Templates (a predesigned row of elements from either Salient's collection of templates at "Salient Templates" or your collection of templates at "My Templates"). You click either Template collection to look for a row that the Salient team or you designed that you want to add at the current page. 

Note: Although "Salient Templates" and "My Templates" look like a toggle group button where one button is mutually exclusive to the other buttons and by the user clicking it, it switches on which types of elements the "+" add button allows you to add - that is not the case here. While the design is confusing, Salient meant to say that the Plus and the "Salient Templates" are all Salient's designs and the main actions (two main actions), and that's why they're bordered blue.
