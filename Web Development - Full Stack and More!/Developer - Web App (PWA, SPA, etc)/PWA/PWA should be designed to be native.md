To improve user engagement â€” and potentially boost SEO and word of mouth â€” your web app should feel and behave like a native mobile app.

## General Guidelines - Feel of a web app

## PWA Guidelines for Native Feel and Look

In addition to good visual design, you'll need to implement key PWA features to reinforce a native app feel.

Before diving into the guidelines, itâ€™s important to understand what a PWA actually does when installed. When a user adds your web app to their home screen and opens it, it runs in a simplified browser shell â€” no address bar, tabs, or standard browser UI. This creates an app-like experience, but **you control how it looks**.

Thatâ€™s where branding comes in: use the PWAâ€™s `manifest.json` file to define your appâ€™s **theme color** and **background color**, which appear in the splash screen and title bar. A consistent, well-designed color theme â€” just like regular phone apps have â€” makes your PWA feel polished and professional.

#### âœ… 1. **Customize `manifest.json` for a Native Look**

- Define essential fields like `name`, `short_name`, `start_url`, `display` (`standalone` or `fullscreen`), and `orientation`.
    
- Set `theme_color` and `background_color` to align with your brand. These appear in the appâ€™s splash screen and title bar.
    
- Include multiple icon sizes (e.g., 192Ã—192 and 512Ã—512) to support different devices.

#### âœ… 2. **App-Like Launch Behavior**

- Use `display: standalone` to hide browser UI elements like the address bar and tabs.
- Ensure `start_url` points to a logical entry point, such as a dashboard or main screen.

---

#### âœ… 3. **Splash Screen Branding**

- The launch splash screen pulls styling from the manifest â€” make sure your app icon, background color, and name reflect your brand.

---

#### âœ… 4. **Add-to-Home-Screen Prompt**

- Use the `beforeinstallprompt` event to encourage installation at the right moment.
- Explain the benefits (offline access, faster loading, convenience) to increase opt-in rates.

---

#### âœ… 5. **Offline-Ready User Experience**

- Use a service worker to cache static assets and important pages.
- Provide a clean offline fallback screen â€” not just a browser error.
- Precache core views (e.g., homepage, cart, reader) so the app works without a connection.

---

#### âœ… 6. **Smooth Transitions & Interactions**

- Use CSS or JavaScript to create seamless page transitions (e.g., fades, slides).
- Avoid full-page reloads by implementing client-side routing for SPA-like navigation.

---

#### âœ… 7. **Push Notifications (Optional)**

- Enable push notifications to re-engage users â€” but only with user consent.
- Keep them relevant and timely (e.g., order updates, reminders).

---

#### âœ… 8. **Persistent State & Session Continuity**

- Store preferences and in-progress actions using localStorage, IndexedDB, or the Cache API.
- Restore state quickly when the app is reopened, even offline.

---

#### âœ… 9. **Fast, Responsive Performance**

- Optimize images and code for minimal load time.
- Lazy-load below-the-fold assets and use skeleton loaders to simulate instant interaction.

---

#### âœ… 10. **Full-Screen Mode (Optional)**

- For immersive experiences (like games or video viewers), consider `display: fullscreen` in the manifest.

## iPhone vs Android Detection and Adaption

You may want to consider the an android and an iphone behave a bit differently from each other. You may want the PWA to detect which device the user is on, then adjust the feel and look so the experience is native to the device. Refer to [[Detect android or iphone then adjust the styles]]
