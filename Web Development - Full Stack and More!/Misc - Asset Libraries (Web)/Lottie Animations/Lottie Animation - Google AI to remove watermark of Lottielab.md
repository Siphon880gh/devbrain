- **Free Plan:** Adds a watermark (bottom-right corner)
	- But for educational purposes only - you can use AI to remove the watermark
- **Pro Plan:** $12/month (or $18 if billed monthly)

At Google AU Studioâ€™s Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25-25:  
1. Attach json file
2. Then prompt with:
```
Remove watermark at bottom right for this lottie file
```
3. It will spit out the new json file that has the watermark removed (mostly by cropping the animation canva). It does take a few minutes.

Note: As of 4/2025, Google's AI allows you to go this far.

Note I didn't personally remove the watermark. The AI likely will crop like it's done here.
