Referring to this diagram:

P value is the probability this observed data point would have happened by chance alone for there being no effect (no applied treatment, etc)

So it's compared to a curve of all possible results of the past when there was no special treatment done.

Therefore, 
> **The p-value is based on comparing your observed result to a distribution of all possible results you’d expect _if the null hypothesis were true_** — that is, if **no special treatment** or effect actually existed.

And therefore, you find if the treatment has any real consequence or effective.

Therefore therefore, low p values likely mean the treatment has effect. High p value likely means there treatment has no effect.

LOW P VALUE

Applied a treatment or solution to improve conversion  n a marketing attempt (referring to the video):

HIGH P VALUE

Pretty volatile like usual even after applying treatment or solution to improve conversion in a marketing attempt (referring to the video):
