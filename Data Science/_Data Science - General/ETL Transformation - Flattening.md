## 🧹 Flattening Nested Data in ETL Pipelines

In data science and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows, it's common to work with hierarchical or nested data structures—especially when ingesting JSON from APIs or NoSQL databases. However, many analytics tools, relational databases, or flat-file formats (like CSV) prefer **flat** structures for easier querying and processing.

One key transformation technique used to handle this is called **flattening nested data**.

### 🔁 What Is Data Flattening?

**Flattening** is the process of converting a nested or hierarchical data structure into a flat, one-level format. This transformation promotes nested fields to the top level, often by extracting key values from embedded objects or arrays.

---

### 🧩 Example: Flattening a Nested JSON Object

Here’s a nested JSON input, as you might receive from an external API or data warehouse export:

```json
{
  "salesperson": "Bob",
  "region": "East",
  "amount": 600,
  "date": "2025-06-10",
  "timeDifference": {
    "days": 0
  }
}
```

In this structure, the `timeDifference` field is a nested object that only contains one key: `days`.

To simplify this for reporting or storage, we might **flatten** it into the following:

```json
{
  "salesperson": "Bob",
  "region": "East",
  "amount": 600,
  "date": "2025-06-10",
  "dayDifference": 0
}
```

The nested object has been removed, and the relevant field has been promoted to a top-level key with a more descriptive name: `dayDifference`.

### 🛠️ Why Flattening Is Important

- ✅ **Tabular compatibility:** Most BI tools and databases work best with flat schemas.
    
- ✅ **Simplified querying:** Easier to write SQL-like queries or aggregate reports.
    
- ✅ **Improved readability:** Cleaner structure for human inspection or downstream processing.
    
- ✅ **Schema consistency:** Helps enforce a predictable schema across datasets.

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**Flattening**|Removing nesting by promoting inner fields to the top level.|
|**Normalization**|In relational databases: splitting into logical tables to reduce redundancy. In ETL: may refer to making data uniform in structure or type.|
|**Transformation**|General term for modifying or restructuring data during ETL.|
|**Denormalization**|Adding structure or redundancy for performance (opposite of normalization).|

### 💬 Discussion

#### 🧮 Is Flattening a Form of Normalization?

**It depends on context.**  
In traditional relational database design, **normalization** refers to organizing data into separate related tables to reduce redundancy. In contrast, **flattening** usually collapses structure for simplicity and processing ease—essentially the opposite.

However, in **ETL or data wrangling**, the term “normalization” can sometimes be used more loosely to mean **standardizing or restructuring data** into a usable form. Under that lens, flattening might be _seen_ as a part of normalization by some data engineers.

#### 🔧 Is Flattening a Type of Transformation?

**Yes.**  
Flattening is a **subset of data transformation**, one of the key steps in ETL. Any time you restructure data—whether flattening, renaming fields, converting types, or aggregating—you’re performing a transformation.

#### 👥 How Different Job Roles Might Refer to It

|Role|Likely Term Used|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|**Data Engineer**|Flattening, transformation|Usually refers to pipeline processes (e.g., Airflow, Spark).|
|**ETL Developer**|Transformation, flattening|More focused on tooling like Talend, Informatica, n8n.|
|**Data Analyst**|Cleaning, prepping data|May not call it "flattening" but rather "getting it ready for Excel or SQL."|
|**BI Developer**|Shaping data, flattening|Often flattens for dashboard compatibility.|
|**Database Architect**|Normalization/denormalization|Often avoids flattening unless for performance.|

### ✅ Summary

When you simplify:

```json
"timeDifference": { "days": 0 }
```

into:

```json
"dayDifference": 0
```

You're performing **flattening**—a key transformation step that makes data easier to analyze, report, and store.

Different teams may describe this step with slightly different terminology depending on their goals and tools, but the purpose remains the same: making data cleaner and easier to work with.
