### ðŸ”¹ Two Meanings of Normalization:

| **1. Scaling or Standardizing Values** | Data Science / Analytics | Transforming numerical values into a comparable range (e.g., 0â€“1 or z-scores) for better model performance or interpretation. |
| **2. Database Normalization**          | Relational Databases     | Structuring tables to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity by using keys and splitting into related tables.           |
### ðŸ”¸ **1. Normalization in Data Analysis (Scaling/Standardizing)**

**Normalization**, in the context of data, can refer to different processes depending on the domain. It generally involves transforming data into a more usable and efficient formatâ€”either by scaling values in analytics or by restructuring data in databases.

Imagine you're analyzing the sales of different products. Your data might include raw sales figures like:

- **$10,000,000 for Product A**
- **$1,000,000 for Product B**

Comparing these raw numbers directly can be misleading because they donâ€™t consider the scale of the business or the product line.

**Normalization** in this context could mean:

- **Scaling:**  
    Convert raw sales into proportions of total sales. If total sales are $20,000,000:
    
    - Product A â†’ 0.5 (or 50%)
    - Product B â†’ 0.05 (or 5%)
    
    This allows for **relative performance comparison**.
    
- **Standardizing (Z-score):**  
    Transform values so they have a **mean of 0** and **standard deviation of 1**. Useful when comparing features with different scales (e.g., sales in dollars vs. customer ratings).

### ðŸ”¸ **2. Normalization in Databases (Reducing Redundancy)**

In relational databases, **normalization** means organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity.

Example:
- You have a `Customers` table and an `Orders` table.
- Each order stores the customer's full address. This is **redundant** and error-prone.

**Normalized approach:**

- Create a separate `Addresses` table.
- Store each address once and reference it from both `Customers` and `Orders` using a foreign key.

This structure:
- Minimizes duplication
- Improves data integrity
- Makes updates easier
