Explain the P here 
Results In terms of gastrointestinal symptoms, night shift workers complained more of indigestion than non-shift workers (P<0.01), and the rate of gastritis was higher.

\>>
In this context, "P<0.01" likely refers to the p-value, which is a measure of the statistical significance of the observed results. A p-value less than 0.01 indicates a very low probability that the observed differences between night shift workers and non-shift workers occurred by chance alone. Therefore, the statement suggests that the difference in the prevalence of indigestion between the two groups is statistically significant.

How they arrived to that p value

To determine the p-value, statistical tests were likely conducted on the data comparing the rates of indigestion between night shift workers and non-shift workers. Commonly, researchers use statistical tests like t-tests or chi-square tests, depending on the nature of the data. The p-value indicates the probability of obtaining the observed results (or more extreme) if there were no real difference between the two groups.

A p-value less than 0.05 is often considered statistically significant, meaning the observed differences are unlikely to be due to random chance. In this case, with a p-value less than 0.01, the results are even more robust, suggesting a high level of confidence in the observed association between night shift work and a higher rate of indigestion.

How to calculate that p value

\>>
Calculating a p-value involves using statistical tests appropriate for the study design and type of data. Here are two common scenarios:

1. **Independent Samples T-Test (for continuous data):**
   - If the data on indigestion is continuous (e.g., measured on a scale), researchers might use an independent samples t-test.
   - The t-test compares the means of two independent groups (night shift workers vs. non-shift workers) to determine if they are significantly different.
   - The calculated t-statistic is then compared to a t-distribution, and the p-value is obtained.

2. **Chi-Square Test (for categorical data):**
   - If the data is categorical (e.g., presence or absence of indigestion), a chi-square test may be used.
   - The chi-square test assesses whether the distribution of categorical variables differs from what would be expected by chance.
   - The test generates a chi-square statistic, and its significance is determined by comparing it to a chi-square distribution, resulting in the p-value.

The specific details would depend on the statistical method chosen, and the software used (like R, Python, or statistical packages). Researchers typically use statistical software to perform these calculations due to their complexity and the need for accurate analysis.
