### âœ… Mind the differences:

- **GitHub Actions** = **Server-side automation** on GitHub (after code is pushed).
- **Git Hooks** = **Local automation** on your machine (before push).
    

They are **separate systems** â€” you can use one, both, or neither depending on your workflow.

### ðŸ”„ **GitHub Actions vs Git Hooks**

|Aspect|GitHub Actions|Git Hooks|
|---|---|---|
|**Lives in**|`.github/workflows/` directory in your repo (YAML files)|`.git/hooks/` folder (local to your Git repo)|
|**Triggered by**|GitHub events (e.g. push, PR, release) â€” on GitHub servers|Git commands run locally (e.g. `pre-commit`, `post-merge`)|
|**Runs on**|GitHub-hosted runners or your custom runners|Only on the local machine where Git is used|
|**Purpose**|Automate CI/CD: test, build, deploy, etc.|Enforce local rules: lint before commit, validate messages, etc.|

Here is a breakdown of example use cases so you know which one to use:


## âœ… When to Use **Git Hooks or GitHub Actions**

| Workflow Stage         | Use Git Hook? âœ…    | Use GitHub Action? âœ…                     | Why?                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Before committing code | Yes (`pre-commit`) | No                                       | Run linters, formatters, and basic tests fast **before code leaves your machine**.                  |
| Before pushing code    | Yes (`pre-push`)   | No                                       | Prevent pushing broken code by running quick tests locally.                                         |
| After code is pushed   | No                 | Yes (`on: push`)                         | Run full test suites, deploy to staging, notify teams â€” actions that require server-side resources. |
| On pull request        | No                 | Yes (`on: pull_request`)                 | Automatically test, lint, or review code for PR quality.                                            |
| On deployment          | No                 | Yes (`on: release`, `workflow_dispatch`) | Package and deploy to production or external services.                                              |

However you could use them together.

## ðŸ§ª Example Use of Both

### 1. **Git Hook (local)** â€” Pre-commit

```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/sh
npx eslint . || exit 1
npx prettier --check . || exit 1
```

- Prevents committing bad code or inconsistent formatting.
    

### 2. **GitHub Action (remote)** â€” Full CI on Push

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: CI Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
```

- Ensures all tests pass in a clean environment â€” catching things your local machine might miss.
