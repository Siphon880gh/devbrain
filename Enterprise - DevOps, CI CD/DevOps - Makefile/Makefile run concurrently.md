## Run concurrently indiscriminately

Here's an example of using the `-j` option with a Makefile to run tasks in parallel:

### Makefile:
```make
all: task1 task2 task3

task1:
 echo "Running task 1"
 sleep 2
 echo "Finished task 1"

task2:
 echo "Running task 2"
 sleep 2
 echo "Finished task 2"

task3:
 echo "Running task 3"
 sleep 2
 echo "Finished task 3"
```

### Command to run tasks in parallel:
```bash
make -j 3
```

In this example, the `-j 3` flag tells Make to run up to 3 tasks in parallel. Instead of running `task1`, `task2`, and `task3` sequentially, they will execute simultaneously (limited by the number you specify). You can adjust the number after `-j` to fit your CPU core count for better performance.

### How it decides which tasks to run

When you run `make -j 3`, it doesn't strictly execute tasks in the order they're listed in the Makefile. Instead, `-j 3` tells `make` to run up to 3 tasks in parallel. The order of execution depends on task dependencies. If certain tasks can be run independently (i.e., they don't depend on each other), `make` will execute up to 3 of those tasks simultaneously.

Here's how it works:

- If the tasks have dependencies, `make` will first ensure that the dependencies are satisfied before running a task.
- If there are no dependencies between tasks, it will try to execute up to 3 tasks concurrently.

For example, if you have the following Makefile:

```makefile
all: task1 task2 task3

task1:
    @echo "Running task1"
    sleep 2

task2:
    @echo "Running task2"
    sleep 1

task3:
    @echo "Running task3"
    sleep 3
```

Running `make -j 3` would attempt to run `task1`, `task2`, and `task3` in parallel, depending on whether they have dependencies or can be run independently.

Let me know if you have a specific case you're dealing with!

## Run concurrently specified tasks

If you want to run specific tasks in parallel using the `-j` option, you can specify the tasks directly in the command. Here's an example based on the previous Makefile:

### Command to run specific tasks in parallel:
```bash
make -j 2 task1 task2
```

This command will run `task1` and `task2` in parallel, up to 2 tasks at a time (as specified by `-j 2`). If you don't specify `-j`, the tasks would run sequentially. 

If you include more tasks than the limit set by `-j`, Make will execute them in batches up to the limit. For example:

```bash
make -j 2 task1 task2 task3
```

This would execute `task1` and `task2` in parallel first, and once one of them finishes, it will start `task3`.
