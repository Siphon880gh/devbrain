To select and run a specific Makefile when you have multiple Makefiles in the same directory, you can use the `-f` option followed by the Makefile name.

### Example:

If you have two Makefiles:

- `Makefile1`
- `Makefile2`

You can specify which Makefile to use with the `-f` flag.

### Command to run a specific Makefile:
```bash
make -f Makefile1
```

Or for the second Makefile:
```bash
make -f Makefile2
```

You can still combine this with `-j` or specify targets:
```bash
make -f Makefile1 -j 2 target1 target2
``` 

This will run `target1` and `target2` from `Makefile1` in parallel.
