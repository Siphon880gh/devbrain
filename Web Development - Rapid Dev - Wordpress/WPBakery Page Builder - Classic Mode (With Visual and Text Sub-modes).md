## Classic Mode

Classic Mode allows you to fine tune the layout and design with the shortcodes of WPBakery (AKA VIsual Composer) which is the backbone of Salient theme's site builder

It has two sub-modes called Visual (RTF) and Text.

Notice you see Wordpress style syntax code called shortcodes. While in Classic Mode, the button that was called "Classic Mode" is now called "Backend Editor" because that button always show the name of the mode you'd switch to when clicked, not the name of the mode you're in.

Notice on the top right of the content editing is Visual and Text. Think of Visual as RTF mode that shows you shortcuts, your styled text, and your images.

To find your place among the short codes you may have to rely on the RTF elements of styled texts and images, or do a text search for specific keywords from your live website.

Text mode is ALL TEXT

## Readability
When editing Visual (aka RTF) or Text mode, you can add blank lines and spacing as is necessary to aid your understanding of the shortcodes. Whitespaces are ignored like it is in HTML.

## Case Study

You can ask ChatGPT to explain the shortcodes.

Example:
```
[vc_row_inner column_margin="100px" column_direction="default" column_direction_tablet="default" column_direction_phone="default" bottom_padding="50" text_align="left" row_position="default" row_position_tablet="inherit" row_position_phone="inherit" overflow="visible" pointer_events="all"]
```

ChatGPT:
The text you've provided does indeed look like a shortcode, specifically one that seems to be associated with a page builder plugin rather than WordPress core. The structure [shortcode] is characteristic of WordPress shortcodes, but the details inside the brackets can vary widely depending on the plugin or theme that adds them.
In your example, [vc_row_inner ...] is likely a shortcode from a visual composer or page builder plugin. These plugins often add their own set of shortcodes to help users design and structure their web pages with various layouts and elements. The attributes within the shortcode, like column_margin, text_align, overflow, etc., are parameters that control the appearance and behavior of the content or layout element that the shortcode represents.
Such shortcodes are particularly useful for creating complex page layouts and designs without requiring users to have in-depth knowledge of HTML, CSS, or PHP. They're a popular feature in many WordPress themes and plugins, especially those focused on customizability and visual editing.
