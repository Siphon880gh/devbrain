**Error from terminal:**
```
Not doing so will cause this error when running most any Docker commands:
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at [unix:///Users/wengffung/.docker/run/docker.sock.](unix:///Users/wengffung/.docker/run/docker.sock.) Is the docker daemon running?

```

**Solution:**

Run Docker daemon
- Either having installed and run Docker daemon
- Or having installed and run Docker Desktop (GUI for Docker).

Not doing so will cause that error when running most any Docker commands.
