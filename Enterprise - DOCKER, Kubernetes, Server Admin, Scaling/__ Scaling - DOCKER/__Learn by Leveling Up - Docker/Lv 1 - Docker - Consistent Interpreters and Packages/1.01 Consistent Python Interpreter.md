**Goal: Dockerize a script.**
**Requirements**: Have installed Docker on local computer AND remote server.

Create a script that prints "Hello, my Python version is:" followed by the Python version, ensuring it always runs Python 3.9, regardless of the system. To achieve this, you'll write a Dockerfile.  
  
Users use the docker command or Docker gui software to build a virtualizable "image" from your Dockerfile. Docker is keen to the computer's architecture so the image can be virtualized compatibly on that system.

An "image" file is stored centrally on their system which they can access with the command `docker images`  or listing them in the Docker software. When the user runs `docker run` command, it will virtualize the image, creating a virtual container of an environment to run scripts (as instructed by Dockerfile). Since Docker provides a consistent environment, the script will always use the Linux distro and/or NodeJs interpreter and/or Python interpeter and their packages (as instructed by Dockerfile), preventing compatibility issues and unexpected behavior across different computers.  
  
Your Dockerfile will contain a base image for which docker will fetch online, usually the NodeJs or Python version. Depending on if you're creating a nodejs or python script, the linux OS could differ. Refer to [[Docker zUse Case - App with NodeJS, Python, with or without OS Bundled]] for a list of nodejs and python interpreters and their bundled os. If you wish for a different linux os than the one bundled with nodejs or python, you may use nvm or pyenv (respectively) in lieu of an interpreter base image, and then the base image would be your Linux Os of choice.


---

We will run this on local development, then try it in the remote development. We will confirm hat the output will be the same when we upload the Dockerfile then build and run off that Dockerfile in a remote SSH terminal session. Because the output is the version of python interpreter, it proves a consistent portable Python interpreter can be ported via Dockerfile.

---


**1. Create a Python script at local development**

python.py:
```
import sys

print(f"Hello, my Python version is expected to be around 3.9, and it actually is: {sys.version}") # Prints python version
```

**2. Prepare for Dockerfile**
Create a .dockerignore:
```
.DS_Store
node_modules
package-lock.json
__pycache__
*.pyc
.env
```

**3. Write a Dockerfile**

The Dockerfile is where you define the configuration of your Docker image. Here's an example:
```
# Use the specific NodeJS base image (bundled in Debian)
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container.
# All below commands will work from working directory.
WORKDIR /app

# Copy your application files (if any)
COPY . .

# Specify the command to run your application (optional, depends on your use case)
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

> [!note] CMD
> Basic Syntax
> `COPY <source> <destination>`
> - `<source>`: This specifies the file(s) or directory you want to copy from your local system (relative to the Docker build context).
> - `<destination>`: This is the path inside the image where the file(s) or directory will be copied to.

---

**Important Note** about Images

You will build an image from the Dockerfile. Alternately, you could've pulled an image from Docker Hub https://hub.docker.com/

So image sources can be from:
- Docker hub via `docker pull`  command
- Dockerfile being built with `docker build` command

---


**4. Build the Docker Image**
Run the following command in the directory where your `Dockerfile` is located:

```
docker build -t consistent_python:v1.0 .
```

This will create a Docker image with your exact Python version.

> [!note] Flag -t
> The -t flag in the docker build command stands for "tag". It allows you to specify a name (and optionally a tag) for the Docker image being built. If you wanted to specify a version, you could do: `docker build -t consistent_python:v1.0 .`
> 
> In that case, `v1.0` is the tag assigned to the image.
> 
> If you do not want to write a version tag, you're still required to include `-t` in the command or it would've errored.
> 
> By default, if you don't specify a tag, Docker assigns the tag latest.
> So running `docker build -t consistent_python .` is equivalent to running `docker build -t consistent_python:latest .`


> [!note] Where are the image files stored?
> 
> That (`docker build -t consistent_python .`) builds the image based on the Dockerfile in your current directory (.), but the resulting image is stored globally within Docker's system, not inside your current folder. It is stored in Docker’s local image registry, which you can inspect with: `docker images`. 
> 
> A Docker image is independent of the working directory where it was created and can be used from anywhere. In a Dockerfile, some commands are build-time commands, which are executed when the image is built, while others are runtime commands, which are executed when a container is started from the image.
> - COPY is a build-time command used to transfer files from the host system into the image.
> - WORKDIR is a build-time command that sets the working directory for subsequent instructions, but it also affects runtime by determining the default directory where commands like CMD or ENTRYPOINT execute inside the container.
> - CMD ["python", "app.py"] is a runtime command that specifies the default command to execute when the container runs.
>   
>   Do I need to know the file location of the image so I can share it online? NO. The image file is tied to your system's architecture. So the best practice is for end users to re-build the image from your Dockerfile (along with the other files like python or nodejs scripts in the same folder), then they can run a virtual container off of that image.


**5. Run the Docker Container**

Once the image is built, you can create and run a container from it:
```
docker run -it consistent_python:v1.0
```

Your output could be:
```
Hello, my Python version is expected to be around 3.9, and it actually is: 3.9.21 (main, Feb 25 2025, 10:00:15) [GCC 12.2.0]
```

This runs once then returns to your shell session because app.py doesn't keep the script process continually running like a Python Flask does.


> [!note] Flags -it
> 
> The `-it` flag in `docker run -it` stands for:
> 
> - **`-i` (interactive mode)** → Keeps **STDIN open**, allowing you to provide input to the container.
> - **`-t` (pseudo-TTY)** → Allocates a **terminal session** inside the Debian container.


> [!note] Process terminates
> The virutalized container closes right away. If you run `docker ps` which lists all the running processes (aka virtualize containers), you won't find `consistent_python`


> [!note] Cat OS
> Since you can run a virtual container off the image, here you can prove that the python base image includes Debian. Run:
> `docker run --rm consistent_python:v1.0 cat /etc/os-release`
> The `--rm` is just a best practice to close the container after running the command in the container's shell and getting the output, though not needed here since the app.py does not keep opened.

**6. Test on remote system:**
Copy your folder of files (with the app.py, Dockerfile, .dockerignore) into a remote server. Then SSH and repeat the steps to check it's the same output when you build then run the image. If your remote server does not have Docker, look up instructions on installing Docker for that distro.
