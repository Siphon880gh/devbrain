At this point you should intuitively understand when you see a Dockerfile in a repo, the author intended you to create an image then run the image, rather than starting the app in other ways (like `npm start` off of package.json).

If the base image in Dockerfile is NodeJS or Python, then there is already a Linux distro bundled in (you need a computer OS for NodeJS or Python process to even run in a terminal session or in the background). Refer to [[Docker zUse Case - App with NodeJS, Python, with or without OS Bundled]]. The container is like a VM that your computer communicates with.
