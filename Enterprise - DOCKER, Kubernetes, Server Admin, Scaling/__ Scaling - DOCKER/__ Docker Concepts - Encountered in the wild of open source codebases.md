When working with open-source apps, you’ll often come across a **Dockerfile** in the project’s root directory. This file defines the instructions to build a **Docker image**—which is like a snapshot of a working app environment. You can build the image using:

```bash
docker build -t your-image-name .
```

This image includes everything the app needs to run: the OS base, libraries, dependencies, environment setup, and a command to start the app.

### Pulling Prebuilt Images from Docker Hub

Not all projects require you to build your own image. Many popular open-source apps are already **published as prebuilt images** on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), a public image registry. You can pull and run these with:

```bash
docker pull IMAGE_NAME
```

This is often the fastest way to get up and running—especially for databases, caching services, and other infrastructure components.

### Coordinating Multiple Containers: `docker-compose.yml`

If an application needs **multiple services to work together**—like a web app that talks to a database—you might encounter a `docker-compose.yml` file. This file defines how to run a group of containers as one application stack.

For example, a `docker-compose.yml` might declare:

- An app container (built from a Dockerfile or pulled from Docker Hub)
    
- A database container (e.g., Postgres or MySQL)
    
- Network settings so containers can talk to each other (e.g., the app accesses the database using `db:5432`)
    

You run everything with a single command:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This sets up the containers, networking, and any shared volumes.

### Managing Docker: CLI vs Docker Desktop

There are two primary ways to interact with Docker:

- **Docker CLI (Command Line Interface):**  
    The terminal-based tool to manage images and containers. You can run commands like `docker run`, `docker ps`, `docker build`, etc.
    
- **Docker Desktop:**  
    A GUI application for macOS, Windows, and Linux that provides a visual interface to manage containers, images, volumes, and networks. It’s great for inspecting and troubleshooting without relying entirely on terminal commands.

### Summary

- **Dockerfile**: Script to build a Docker image—often found in open-source app repos.
    
- **Docker Hub**: Source of prebuilt images you can pull and run instantly.
    
- **docker-compose.yml**: Defines how multiple containers work together in a single application.
    
- **Docker CLI vs Docker Desktop**: Two interfaces to manage your Docker setup—terminal or GUI.
    

Docker makes it easy to work with open-source apps, whether you’re using them as part of your own system or just trying them out locally.
