Titled: Self-Hosting Open Source Docker Apps - Reverse Proxy Gotchas

How to use: Turn on persistent "Table of Contents"

---

If you're a developer exploring open source apps and trying to self-host them with Docker, you're likely doing it to save time building tools from scratch. Many of these apps come with prebuilt Docker solutions, making setup relatively painless ‚Äî until reverse proxying gets involved.

One common challenge arises when you want to expose these Dockerized apps through a reverse proxy like Nginx, especially when using custom paths or subdomains.

---

### üîÅ Reverse Proxying to a Subpath (e.g. `domain.com/some/app`)

Some Docker images work seamlessly when reverse proxied to a subpath like `/some/app`. If that‚Äôs the case ‚Äî perfect! You can set up your reverse proxy and you're done. The app likely handles subpath routing correctly by using relative asset paths or dynamically determining its base URL (e.g., using `window.location`) to build asset and API routes properly.

However, **many Docker images break** in this setup. That‚Äôs usually because their static assets and internal routes are hardcoded to the root path (`/`). When accessed under a subpath, the app tries to load resources from the wrong location ‚Äî leading to broken UIs, 404s, and console errors.

If this happens, you have two main options:

---

### üõ† Option 1: Reconfigure the App to Use a Custom Base Path

Check whether the app allows configuring a custom "site URL" or base path (e.g., `/some/app`).

- If **yes**:  
	You‚Äôll need to rebuild or override the Docker image with the appropriate configuration ‚Äî such as setting `BASE_URL=/some/app` or a similar environment variable. This ensures the app generates links and loads assets relative to the correct path.
	
	To find out if this is supported, try Googling the app name with keywords like:
	- Environmental Variables: `BASE_URL`, `PUBLIC_PATH`, `SITE_URL`, `APP_ROOT`, `SERVER_ROOT`
	- JS Variants like `baseURL`, `publicPath`, `siteUrl`, etc.
	- Or Python or PHP variants like `base_url`, `public_path`, `site_url`, etc.
	
	These settings might appear:
	- As environment variables in the Dockerfile
	- Inside a `config.json` file (commonly in the root or a `config/` directory)
	- Embedded in build tools like Webpack or frameworks like Vue, React, etc.
	- Less often - inside the app code
    
- If **no**:  
    The app can‚Äôt support subpath hosting without serious modifications ‚Äî you‚Äôll need to switch to a subdomain approach.

### üåê Option 2: Use a Subdomain Instead (e.g. `app.domain.com`)

When an app insists on serving from `/`, reverse proxying it to a **subdomain** is the cleaner path.

But there‚Äôs a checklist of setup steps:

1. **DNS Configuration**  
    Add an `A` or `CNAME` record for `app.domain.com` pointing to your server.
    
2. **TLS/SSL Certificate**  
    For HTTPS to work:
    
    - Ensure the subdomain is publicly reachable.
        
    - Your certificate provider (e.g., Let‚Äôs Encrypt) will try to complete an ACME HTTP-01 challenge.
        
    - That means `http://app.domain.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/...` must be accessible before issuing the cert.
        
    - Only after the cert is issued should you finalize the reverse proxy rule for HTTPS traffic.
        
3. **Reverse Proxy Routing**  
    Once TLS is ready, proxy all requests from `app.domain.com` to the app's internal container port. Since the app expects `/`, everything will route cleanly.

### üö® Last Resort: Direct Access via Port Number

If reverse proxying proves too complex or not viable, or the app is only for internal use:

- You can expose the app directly at `http://yourdomain.com:1234`.
    
- This avoids dealing with reverse proxies or TLS setup.
    
- **Use caution**: this is only acceptable for internal tools or testing environments. It leaves the app unauthenticated and unsecured by HTTPS.

## üîÅ Refresher - Reverse Proxy Setup (with Security & WebSocket Support)

Once you've chosen whether to reverse proxy to a **subpath** or **subdomain**, here‚Äôs a practical refresher to get it working securely ‚Äî including support for **WebSockets**, which some Dockerized apps use for real-time updates.

At a high level, your reverse proxy listens on a public URL (like `domain.com/some/app` or `app.domain.com`) and forwards traffic to your Docker app running on a local port (e.g., `localhost:8000`).

---

### üìÑ Nginx Example

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location /some/app/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000/;

        # WebSocket support
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

        # Standard headers
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

---

### üìÑ Apache Example

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName yourdomain.com

    ProxyPreserveHost On

    # Reverse proxy for app
    ProxyPass /some/app/ http://localhost:8000/
    ProxyPassReverse /some/app/ http://localhost:8000/

    # WebSocket route (adjust path if needed)
    ProxyPass /ws/ ws://localhost:8000/ws/
    ProxyPassReverse /ws/ ws://localhost:8000/ws/
</VirtualHost>
```

> If your app uses WebSockets (e.g., for live chat, dashboard updates, or syncing), make sure to proxy WebSocket routes like `/ws/`, `/socket.io/`, or whichever your app uses. You can confirm this using browser DevTools ‚Üí Network ‚Üí WS tab.

---

### üîí Restrict Port Access with a Firewall

Your app runs on a local port (like `8000`), but **you don‚Äôt want that port exposed to the public** ‚Äî only your reverse proxy should access it. Use a firewall to lock it down.

#### UFW (Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo ufw deny in on eth0 to any port 8000
```

#### iptables

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8000 -s 127.0.0.1 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8000 -j DROP
```

#### firewalld (CentOS/RHEL)

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule='rule family=ipv4 source address=127.0.0.1 port port=8000 protocol=tcp accept'
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-port=8000/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

By correctly reverse proxying, supporting WebSockets, and securing open ports, your Dockerized app will be production-ready ‚Äî whether it lives on a subpath or subdomain.

Let me know if you want to include HTTPS configuration (e.g., Let‚Äôs Encrypt with Certbot) as a next step.
