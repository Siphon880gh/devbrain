### Process-Level Scaling

**Process-level scaling** involves increasing the number of processes that can handle incoming requests. Each process operates independently, allowing the application to handle more concurrent requests by distributing the workload across multiple processes. This can be particularly useful for both CPU-bound and I/O-bound applications.
