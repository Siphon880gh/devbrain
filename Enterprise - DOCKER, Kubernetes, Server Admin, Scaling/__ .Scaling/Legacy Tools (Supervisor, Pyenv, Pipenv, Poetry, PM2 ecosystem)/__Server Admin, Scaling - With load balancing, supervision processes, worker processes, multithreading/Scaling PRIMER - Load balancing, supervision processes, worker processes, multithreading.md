The techniques/technologies help with scaling, especially with increased traffic, higher demand for computing resources, etc:

---

### **1. Load Balancing**

- **Category**: **Traffic Management / Scaling Infrastructure**
- **Explanation**: Load balancing ensures efficient distribution of incoming requests across multiple servers or processes. This prevents overloading a single server, improves response times, and provides high availability by rerouting traffic in case of failures.

---

### **2. Supervision Processes**

- **Category**: **Process Management / Reliability**
- **Explanation**: Supervision tools (e.g., Supervisor, systemd, PM2) monitor and manage application processes, ensuring that they stay running. They restart processes automatically in case of crashes, which enhances reliability and fault tolerance.

---

### **3. Worker Processes**

- **Category**: **Concurrency / Parallelism**
- **Explanation**: Worker processes (e.g., Gunicorn, PM2) enable the application to handle multiple tasks concurrently by spawning multiple instances of the application or background jobs. This is particularly useful for scaling workloads efficiently across available system resources.

---

### **4. Multithreading**

- **Category**: **Concurrency / Optimization**
- **Explanation**: Multithreading allows an application to execute multiple threads within the same process, enabling it to perform several tasks simultaneously. This is beneficial for CPU-bound or I/O-bound tasks to optimize resource usage and improve performance under load.
