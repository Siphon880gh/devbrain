`pyenv` and `pipenv` are both popular tools in the Python community, but they serve different purposes in Python environment management. Here’s a breakdown of what each tool is primarily used for and how they differ:

### pyenv
- **Purpose:** `pyenv` is used to manage multiple versions of Python itself. It allows you to install several versions of Python on a single system and switch between them easily.
- **Functionality:** With `pyenv`, you can choose which Python version to use on a global, per-user, or per-project basis. It doesn't directly handle package dependencies.
- **Usage Scenario:** Useful if you need to ensure compatibility across different Python versions for various projects or if you're testing your code across multiple Python environments.

### pipenv
- **Purpose:** `pipenv` is intended to manage Python packages within a specific project. It combines package management (`pip`) and virtual environment management (`venv`) into a single tool.
- **Functionality:** `pipenv` automatically creates and manages a virtual environment for your projects, tracks package dependencies, and generates a `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` to keep dependencies consistent across installations.
- **Usage Scenario:** Ideal for developers looking for a robust workflow tool that can manage package dependencies and their versions while ensuring that projects are developed in a consistent environment.

### Comparison and Integration
- **Integration:** While `pyenv` and `pipenv` serve different purposes, they can be integrated to provide a comprehensive environment and dependency management solution. You can use `pyenv` to manage which Python version is used and `pipenv` to handle virtual environments and package dependencies for that specific Python version.
- **Who Should Use Them:** Both tools are geared towards developers who need to manage complex projects with specific requirements regarding the Python version and package dependencies.

In practice, using both tools together can streamline your Python development workflow, allowing you to precisely control both your Python runtime and your project environments.

## Pyenv vs pipenv

[https://chatgpt.com/c/f461b64f-d028-4e2d-9fee-c2c2911c5c95](https://chatgpt.com/c/f461b64f-d028-4e2d-9fee-c2c2911c5c95)  

TLDR you need both if you want consistent python version and pip packages. Pipfile's python version will have pipenv try to use that version but it’s not as comprehensive as pyenv that gives you powerhouse of features like switching python versions by command. 

Activate pyenv's virtual environment first, then manage package installations with pipenv secondly. You'll hear pipenv complain it won’t use its own virtual environment because it's already inside pyenv's virtual environment. Pipenv also wont let you start a pipenv environment with “pipenv shell”. But that’s all fine! 

It's fine because pipenv will save the per-project packages and dependencies to the pyenv environment if saving to a pipenv environment is redundant

You can prove this by being inside pyenv virtual environment, then running this used to display the path to the virtual environment associated with the current project according to pipenv
```
pipenv --venv  
```
  
Then you will see:
- `Courtesy Notice: Pipenv found itself running within a virtual environment, so it will automatically use that environment, instead of creating its own for any project. You can set **PIPENV_IGNORE_VIRTUALENVS=1** to force pipenv to ignore that environment and create its own instead. You can set **PIPENV_VERBOSITY=-1** to suppress this warning.`
- Followed by a pyenv sounding path, like: `/root/.pyenv/versions/3.6.15/envs/app`
