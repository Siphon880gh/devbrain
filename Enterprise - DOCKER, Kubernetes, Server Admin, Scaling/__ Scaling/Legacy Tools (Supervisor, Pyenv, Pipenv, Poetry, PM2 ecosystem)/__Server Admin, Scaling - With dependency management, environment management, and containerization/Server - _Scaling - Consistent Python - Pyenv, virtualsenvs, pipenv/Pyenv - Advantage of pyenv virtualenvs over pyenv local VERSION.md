Using `pyenv virtualenvs` offers several advantages over using `pyenv local VERSION` alone. Here are some of the key benefits:

### 1. **Isolation of Dependencies:**
   - **pyenv virtualenvs**: Each virtual environment created with `pyenv virtualenv` is isolated, meaning that the packages installed in one virtual environment do not affect others. This is useful for managing dependencies for different projects separately, avoiding conflicts and ensuring that each project has the exact packages it needs.
   - **pyenv local VERSION**: When you set a local Python version using `pyenv local`, all packages installed are shared among all projects using that version. This can lead to conflicts if different projects require different versions of the same package.

### 2. **Environment-Specific Configurations:**
   - **pyenv virtualenvs**: You can configure each virtual environment individually, allowing for environment-specific settings, scripts, and tools. This is particularly useful for testing different setups or configurations.
   - **pyenv local VERSION**: While you can set up project-specific configurations, they are tied to the same global Python version, making it less flexible.

### 3. **Ease of Switching and Management:**
   - **pyenv virtualenvs**: Switching between different environments is straightforward with commands like `pyenv activate` and `pyenv deactivate`. You can quickly switch to a different environment without affecting the global Python setup.
   - **pyenv local VERSION**: While you can switch Python versions using `pyenv local`, it doesn't provide the same level of flexibility for managing multiple isolated environments.

### 4. **Consistent Development Environments:**
   - **pyenv virtualenvs**: Ensures that each developer or CI/CD pipeline uses the exact same environment, reducing "works on my machine" issues. You can share virtual environment definitions (e.g., via `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile`) to ensure consistency.
   - **pyenv local VERSION**: While you can ensure the same Python version is used, managing dependencies can become cumbersome without the isolation provided by virtual environments.

### 5. **Simplified Upgrades and Maintenance:**
   - **pyenv virtualenvs**: Upgrading or changing dependencies can be done within a virtual environment without affecting other projects. This makes it easier to test new versions of libraries or Python itself.
   - **pyenv local VERSION**: Upgrading packages might affect all projects using that Python version, leading to potential issues with backward compatibility.

### 6. **Compatibility with Other Tools:**
   - **pyenv virtualenvs**: Works well with other virtual environment tools like `virtualenvwrapper` or `pipenv`, providing additional flexibility and features.
   - **pyenv local VERSION**: Primarily focuses on managing Python versions and does not offer the same level of integration with other virtual environment management tools.

In summary, using `pyenv virtualenvs` provides a more robust, flexible, and isolated environment for managing Python project dependencies, configurations, and versions, making it a better choice for most development workflows compared to just using `pyenv local VERSION`.
