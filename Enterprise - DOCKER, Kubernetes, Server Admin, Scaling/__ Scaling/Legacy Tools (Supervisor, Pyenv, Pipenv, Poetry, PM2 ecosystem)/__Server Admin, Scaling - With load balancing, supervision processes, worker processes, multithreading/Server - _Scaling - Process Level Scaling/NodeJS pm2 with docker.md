Yes, Docker can be used to run multiple Node.js applications on your VPS, and it's a very common use case. Docker allows you to containerize your applications, each with their own dependencies, environment, and configuration, isolated from each other. This can be very beneficial for managing multiple applications, as it helps to avoid dependency conflicts and makes deployment more consistent and reproducible.

PM2 is a process manager for Node.js applications that allows you to keep applications alive forever, reload them without downtime, and facilitate common system admin tasks. PM2 is typically used without Docker, directly on the host machine, to manage multiple Node.js processes.

Here are some considerations to help you decide between Docker and PM2:

**Docker:**
- Isolation: Each application runs in its own container with its own environment.
- Consistency: Containers are consistent across different environments, which reduces "it works on my machine" problems.
- Microservices: Ideal if you're adopting a microservices architecture.
- Scalability: Docker containers can be easily scaled with orchestration tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
- Portability: Containers can be moved across environments or cloud providers with ease.

**PM2:**
- Simplicity: Easier to set up and manage if you are not familiar with Docker.
- In-place: Works directly on the host OS, which might be preferred in simple deployment scenarios.
- Resource Overhead: Generally less overhead than Docker since you're not running the extra Docker layer.
- Zero-downtime deployments: PM2 can reload your applications without downtime.
- Load balancing: PM2 allows you to spread your application across all CPUs available.

In summary, if you need the isolation, consistency, and portability that Docker offers, and you are comfortable with the additional complexity, then Docker might be the better choice. If your applications are straightforward, you're not ready to jump into containerization, or you want something quick and easy to manage, PM2 could be the better option. It's also worth noting that Docker and PM2 are not mutually exclusive and can be used together to take advantage of the features of both.

Docker, as a platform, comes in different editions:

1. **Docker Personal**: Docker Personal is free and is aimed at individual developers, open-source projects, and small teams. It provides the core Docker capabilities and can be used to build and share containerized applications and microservices.

2. **Docker Pro, Team, and Business**: These are subscription-based tiers that offer additional features such as container registry services, parallel builds, team collaboration tools, and advanced features like image access management and secure software supply chain capabilities. They are intended for professional developers, larger teams, and organizations that need more advanced features and support.

3. **Docker Engine**: The core component of Docker, Docker Engine, is available in a community edition which is free and an enterprise edition which is part of the Docker Business subscription. The community edition is suitable for most development and small scale production uses.

4. **Docker Desktop**: Docker Desktop is an application for MacOS and Windows that is designed to build and share containerized applications and microservices. Docker Desktop for personal use is free but for professional use in a large company, you may need a paid subscription.

So, whether Docker is free or not depends on your use case. For most individual developers, the free version of Docker provides sufficient functionality. Larger teams and organizations, however, might require the additional features and support that come with a paid subscription.
