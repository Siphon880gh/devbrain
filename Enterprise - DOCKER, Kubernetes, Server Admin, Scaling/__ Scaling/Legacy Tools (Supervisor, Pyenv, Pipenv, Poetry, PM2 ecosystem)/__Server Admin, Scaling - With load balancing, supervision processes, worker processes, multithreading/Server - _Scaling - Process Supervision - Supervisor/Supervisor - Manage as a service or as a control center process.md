You can manage either through systemctl or service or supervisorctl

That's managing through the modern services, through the deprecated services wrapper, or through supervisor as a control center process (supervisorctl)

Refer to [[Dev Linux systemctl vs service]]  and [[Supervisor - systemctl vs supervisorctl]] to see that there's no difference in either way when it comes to the result of shutting down, starting, restarting.
