See all logs:
```
pm2 log
```

See logs for a specific app (as appearing from `pm2 list`)... you need the full name (no partial search)... eg. `pm2 log note-taking:3006`
```
pm2 log appName|appId
```

^ Note if the app name doesn't exist, the terminal will show a blank log and no indication there were any errors

**Another way to see all logs:**

```
pm2 logs --lines 100 | grep -i "appName|appId"
```

^Note if your app name has double colons or other filename-unfriendly symbols, they become a hyphen `-` and you have to adjust the command accordingly.

For example, for an app name `note-taking:3006`, we're actually logging from a `note-taking-3006` file:
```
