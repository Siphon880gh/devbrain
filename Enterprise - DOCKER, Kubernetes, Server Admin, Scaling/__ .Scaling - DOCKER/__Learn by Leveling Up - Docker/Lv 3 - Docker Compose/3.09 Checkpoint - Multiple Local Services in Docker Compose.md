When you visit coding repo's, you may see multiple services from local Dockerfiles. This is done in two ways, though one of them is the best practice.


Here's an example docker-compose.yml with multiple Dockerfile's named differently in the same folder (poor practice):

```
version: "3.8"
services:
  app1:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.app1
    ports:
      "8080:8080"

  app2:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.app2
    ports:
      "8081:8080"

  web:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.web
    ports:
      "80:80"
```

Here's an example docker-compose.yml with multiple Dockerfile's in different folders, so they are all named "Dockerfile" (best practice because least amount of configuration and maintains separation of concerns between service folders):

```
version: "3.8"
services:
  app1:
    build:
      context: ./app1
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"

  app2:
    build:
      context: ./app2
    ports:
      - "8081:8080"

  web:
    build:
      context: ./web
    ports:
      - "80:80"
```
