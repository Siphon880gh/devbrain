Absolutely — here's the updated, fully integrated response including a clear explanation of exporting or tagging earlier stages:

---

### 🐳 Multi-Stage Docker Builds

**Use Case**:  
You want a **production-ready Docker image** that’s small, secure, and fast. Instead of keeping all your build tools (like Node.js, compilers, or package managers), you use **multi-stage builds**:

- One stage builds your app.
- The final stage runs it — using only the minimal runtime environment needed.

---

### 🧠 Example: React Frontend with Node + NGINX

You use `node` to build the React app, but only need NGINX to serve the final static files.

---

### 📁 Project Structure

```
project/
├── frontend/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── src/
└── Dockerfile
```

---

### ✅ Dockerfile (Multi-Stage Build)

```dockerfile
# === Stage 1: Build React frontend ===
FROM node:18-alpine as builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY frontend/package.json frontend/yarn.lock ./
RUN yarn install

COPY frontend/ ./
RUN yarn build

# === Stage 2: Serve with nginx (Final Image) ===
FROM nginx:stable-alpine as production

# Copy build output from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Optional: custom nginx config
# COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

---

### 🧾 What Determines the Final OS?

✅ The final OS is determined by the base image of the **last stage**, which is:

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:stable-alpine
```

So your final container will run on **Alpine Linux**, even though earlier you used `node:18-alpine`.

🧠 Docker only keeps the **last stage by default**. All earlier stages (like the builder) are discarded from the final image — unless...

---

### 🔄 How to Keep or Export Earlier Stages

You can **explicitly tag or export intermediate stages** if you want to use them separately. For example:

```bash
docker build --target builder -t myapp-builder .
```

This builds **only the `builder` stage**, and tags it as `myapp-builder`.

Or to **export both the builder and final stage**:

```bash
# Build the full image
docker build -t myapp-final .

# Separately tag the builder
docker build --target builder -t myapp-builder .
```

This is useful for debugging, caching, or running integration tests using the intermediate build environment.

---
### ✅ Result

- Final image = tiny, secure NGINX container serving static files.
- No build tools like Node.js or Yarn are included.
- Fast startup, minimal attack surface.
