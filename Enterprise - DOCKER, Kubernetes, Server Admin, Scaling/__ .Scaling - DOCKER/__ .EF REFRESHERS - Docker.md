EF REFRESHERS: EASILY FORGOTTEN REFRESHERS

EF are things you easily forget if you haven't done the technology in a while. These Easily Forgotten aspects need to be reviewed, especially to avoid wasting time relearning or rediscovering, especially if the errors are not obvious or may mislead you to wasting time.

### **1:N Image-to-Container Relationship for Scaling**

A single Docker **image** can be used to create multiple **containers**. Each container runs independently, even if based on the same image. For example, you can launch three containers from the same image and map them to different host ports like `3000`, `3001`, and `3002`.

Why: This separation between image and container is what makes Docker inherently scalable — you can spin up as many container instances as needed from the same base image. This was the original intention for Docker.

### Pull, Build, and Run Containers (Single Container)

#### If You _Don't_ Have the Image

**Option 1: Pull from Docker Hub**  
Download the image directly from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull IMAGE_NAME
```

**Option 2: Build from a Dockerfile**  
Create the image locally using a `Dockerfile` in your current directory, while tagging it with a name so you can easily reference it in the run container command:
```bash
docker build -t IMAGE_NAME .
```


#### If You _Have_ the Image

**Run a Container from the Local Image**  
Start a container using the image stored on your machine:

```bash
docker run IMAGE_NAME
```

### Pull, Build, and Run Containers (Multi Container)

Multiple containers need to run on different ports while connecting to each other. They will connect to each other on the same "network", so it won't conflict with containers that are not part of this group of containers.

You run down or shut down at the directory where the docker-compose.yml is at:
- The images are built per the instructions of docker-compose.yml, if there is no image built yet.
- Then those images are ran as containers
- Those containers are assigned hostnames and ports, but they all act on each other in the same network

Spin up:
```
docker compose up
```

However, if you're still developing the docker-compose.yml, you may want to tell Docker to rebuild instead of using a previous build:
```
docker compose up --build
```

Spin down:
```
docker compose down
```

### Host-to-Container Mapping

**In Docker, both port mapping and volume mounting use the syntax: host first, then container.**

- **Port Mapping:**
    ```
    -p HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT
    ```
    
    _Example:_  
    `-p 8080:80` maps port `8080` on your host to port `80` inside the container.
    
- **Volume Mounting:**
    ```
    -v /host/path:/container/path
    ```
    
Example:  
`-v /home/user/data:/app/data` mounts the host directory `/home/user/data` into `/app/data` inside the container.

Mnemonic:
- When entering into the terminal, it usually has your username or home directory then an indicator where you begin typing commands, like:
  ```
	(base) wengffung@Wengs-MacBook-Pro-New push %
	```
- Think that the left side of the double colon ":" is closer to the host machine (where it has the command indicator)
- In other words: To remember this, where you type commands at user%,  the direction is user << host:container. The host is closer to the user% machine.

### **Container Gotchas**

Docker containers are essentially processes running on your host system. Docker wants to emphasize that they're processes, so they subcommand is `ps` instead of the expected `container` if you followed the other subcommand patterns of `image` and `volume`.

You can view all active containers with:

```
docker ps
```

If a container crashes or exits (for example, due to an error or a manual `CMD+D` signal termination), it won’t appear in the default list. To view **all** containers, including those that have exited:

```
docker ps -a
```

You can restart an exited container using:

```
docker restart CONTAINER_ID
```

Note: You **cannot** run `docker run` again on the same container ID — this would result in a conflict. Instead, use `restart` or remove and recreate (`docker remove CONTAINER_ID` then `docker run...`) the container if needed.

This persistent container when it crashes or CMD+D signal termination is because of assuming most users want automated systems: if a container crashes, it can be restarted by a monitoring script or supervisor, allowing resilient and restartable deployments.

If you want a container to auto-restart if it crashes, you add this option when running the container off the image (`docker run...`):
```
--restart=unless-stopped
```

Now if you're testing a new container (like trying out a new open source app), you may want to run the same container again with new options in the `docker run` command. This means you have to `docker stop CONTAINER_ID` to stop it first, then `docker remove CONTAINER_ID`, THEN you may run the new `docker run` command options.

## Lists

Volume:
```
docker volume ls
```

Images:
```
docker image ls
```

Containers (only those running):
```
docker ps
```

Containers (including exited/errored):
```
docker ps -a
```

## Naming Best Practices

Tag your images that you build from Dockerfile:
[[Docker Dockerfile _Best Practice - Tag with -t]]

Name your containers at the run command:
[[Docker zContainers _Best Practice - Run with --name]]

## Reverse Proxying Docker Containers at Port

When self-hosting a Dockerized app that runs on a specific port (e.g., `http://yourdomain.com:3000`), it's common to want to hide the port behind a clean URL — either a subdomain or a path — using a reverse proxy. This not only makes the URL look more professional, but also improves security and flexibility.

In our other guide ([[__COMMON - Workflow - Self-Hosting Open Source Docker Apps - Reverse Proxy Gotchas]]) on reverse proxying Docker containers, we focus on the common pitfalls developers encounter when deploying open source apps with prebuilt Docker solutions. Many of these apps don’t work out-of-the-box behind a reverse proxy due to the way they've coded to deliver static files, especially when served from subpaths. That guide breaks down:

- When subpath proxying works without changes
- When it fails due to hardcoded paths
- How to fix or work around it with subdomain routing, Docker config tweaks, or port-based access

From that guide, you could defer how to code your app so that reverse proxy will work effortlessly.
