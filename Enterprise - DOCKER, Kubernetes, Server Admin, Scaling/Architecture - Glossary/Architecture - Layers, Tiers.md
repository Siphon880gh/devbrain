## Layers, Tiers

- **Layers** focus on _logical_ separations of code (e.g., presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer).
- **Tiers** focus on _physical_ separations in how you deploy or host the application. Traditionally, this means different servers for each tier (e.g., a server for the web front end, another for the application logic, and another for the database). REWORDED: Tiers generally refer to physical or infrastructure separations that often involve different servers (or computing resources in the cloud).

In modern deployments (e.g., cloud, containers, Kubernetes), “tiers” may not always be literal separate machines. Instead, they could be:

- **Separate container clusters** (e.g., front end in one cluster, services in another).
- **Different cloud services** (e.g., AWS Lambda for some functions, an RDS instance for the database, and an EC2 cluster for the main app).

Despite these more flexible hosting options, the _concept_ remains the same: _tiers_ are about _where_ the code runs physically (or at least in physically isolated resources), while _layers_ are about _how_ the code is organized logically.

## Layers: Presentation, Business, Data Access (Persistence Layer)

Below is a concise, bulleted list explaining the **Presentation Layer**, **Business Logic Layer**, and **Data Access Layer** in a typical layered architecture:

---

### **1. Presentation Layer**

- **Purpose**: Handles the user interface and user interactions.
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Displays data to the user in a friendly format (web pages, mobile screens, desktop UI, etc.).
    - Captures user input (e.g., form submissions, button clicks).
    - Passes user requests to the business logic layer, and then updates the UI based on responses.
- **Technology Examples**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript, React, Angular, Swift (for iOS), etc.

---

### **2. Business Logic Layer** (sometimes called the **Application Layer**)

- **Purpose**: Encapsulates the domain-specific rules and processes.
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Orchestrates application workflows (e.g., user registration, order processing).
    - Validates inputs and enforces business rules (e.g., “Only registered users can check out.”).
    - Coordinates data flow between the presentation layer and the data access layer.
- **Technology Examples**: Java, C#, Python, Node.js—typically frameworks that help structure service/business logic.

---

### **3. Data Access Layer** (sometimes called the **Persistence Layer**)

- **Purpose**: Manages database or external data store interactions.
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Executes Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.
    - Translates business objects to database records (and vice versa).
    - Ensures data consistency and handles database connection details.
- **Technology Examples**: SQL or NoSQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB), ORMs (Hibernate, Entity Framework), or direct API calls to data storage services.

---

### **How They Relate**

- **Presentation Layer**: “Front door” of the application, where end users interact.
- **Business Logic Layer**: “Brain” of the application, where decisions and rules are applied.
- **Data Access Layer**: “Back end” for storage, handling how data is persisted and retrieved.

This separation of concerns makes the application easier to maintain, test, and scale.
