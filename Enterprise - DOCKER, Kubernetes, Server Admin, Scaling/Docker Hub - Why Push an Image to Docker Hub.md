### Why Push an Image to Docker Hub?

A common reason to push an image to Docker Hub is when you're trying to run an open-source app locally, but the official image isn't optimized for your system. For example, many images aren't built for ARM64, so they run slowly or glitch on a MacBook Pro with an M1 chip due to emulation.

To fix this, you clone the source code from GitHub and build it natively for your system (e.g., using `npm install`). This often involves resolving version conflicts or tweaking build settings—but once it's working, you don’t want to go through the hassle again. And you might want to help others avoid it too.

So you:

1. Package the working code into a `Dockerfile`
2. Build the image locally
3. Push the image to Docker Hub (`docker login` must be done first)
    

To make your image more usable:

- **Push to GitHub**: Include:
    - The original or modified source code
    - The `Dockerfile`
    - A `README.md` explaining what it is and how to use it
        
- **On Docker Hub**:
    - Go to your image’s page
    - Click **Settings**
    - Set:
        - **Description** (short summary of what the image does)
        - **Source Repository URL** (link to your GitHub repo)
    - Add a **README.md** on Docker Hub for clear usage instructions (you can paste it manually or link from GitHub if supported)

This helps others understand what the image is for, how to use it, and gives them access to the code if they want to inspect or modify it themselves.
