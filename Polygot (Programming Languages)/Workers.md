## 🧰 "Worker" Has Two Meanings Depending on Context

### 🌐 In the Browser:

**Service Worker (Browser API)**  
A Service Worker is a JavaScript file that runs in the background, separate from the main browser thread. It enables advanced client-side features such as:

- Offline caching (via the Cache API)
- Intercepting network requests (via `fetch` events)
- Background sync
- Push notifications

> This is a browser-native API and runs in the client. It's essentially a programmable proxy between the browser and the network.

### 🖥️ On the Server:

There’s no direct equivalent of the browser’s _Service Worker_, but there are server-side "worker"-like roles that serve similar background or async functions:

|Term|Description|Example Technologies|
|---|---|---|
|**Worker Thread / Background Worker**|Runs tasks in parallel to avoid blocking the main thread|`Node.js worker_threads`, `Python Celery`, `Go Goroutines`|
|**Daemon / Service Process**|A persistent background process, often managed by the OS or a task manager|`Systemd`, `PM2`, `Heroku Scheduler`, `AWS Lambda`|
|**Job Queue Worker**|Pulls jobs from a queue and processes them asynchronously|`Redis + BullMQ`, `RabbitMQ`, `Sidekiq (Ruby)`|

> These aren’t “service workers” in the browser sense, but they fulfill a similar purpose — offloading work from the main process.

### 🧠 Quick Summary:

- **Browser Service Worker**  
    JavaScript file that intercepts network requests and enables offline support. Runs in the client.
    
- **Server Worker**  
    A background thread or process that handles async or long-running tasks on the backend. Not related to the browser spec.

### 🚀 Example: Heroku Worker Dynos

In Heroku, _workers_ are additional dynos that run in parallel with your main web process. They're typically used for background jobs or scripts, and are often named `worker.js`, `worker1.js`, etc.

A `Procfile` might look like:

```
web: node server.js  
worker: node worker.js
```

This tells Heroku to run two types of dynos: one for handling web requests and another for background processing.
