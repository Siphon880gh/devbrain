"V2.0.1+58"

Yes, you can use "v2.0.1+58" as a version name in app development. This format is consistent with semantic versioning (SemVer) principles, where "2.0.1" indicates the major, minor, and patch versions, respectively. The "+58" is a build identifier, which is often used to specify builds or revisions. This kind of detailed version naming is useful for tracking specific builds or iterations of your app, especially during development and testing phases.

Regarding the +58, Different builds aren't assigned completely different version numbers for several reasons:

1. **Semantic Versioning Principles**: In semantic versioning (SemVer), the version number (major.minor.patch) communicates changes in the software. Major changes that break compatibility get a new major number, minor updates add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and patches are for backwards-compatible bug fixes. Build identifiers don't change the software's functionality or interface, so they don't warrant a change in the major, minor, or patch numbers.
    
2. **Granularity and Clarity**: Using build identifiers allows for more granular tracking without cluttering the version number. It's easier to track and manage versions when the main version number changes only with functional updates. **The build identifier can track more frequent changes, like builds for testing or MINOR REVISIONS.**
    
3. **Internal vs. External Relevance**: Often, build numbers are more relevant internally (for developers, testers) than externally (for users or clients). **The main version number is what most users see and rely on to understand the level of changes in the app. Build identifiers are more for INTERNAL TRACKING and management of different stages of development.**
    
4. **Continuous Integration and Deployment**: In a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline, new builds are often created automatically with every change in the codebase. Having a new version number for each of these would quickly become unwieldy and impractical.
    
5. **Non-Functional Changes**: Builds often include non-functional changes like configuration changes, environment-specific adjustments, or minor bug fixes that don't change the overall functionality of the software.
    

In summary, different builds are part of the same version of the software because they typically represent incremental, non-functional changes that don't alter the software's overall behavior or interface. The build identifier provides a way to track these changes without affecting the semantic meaning of the main version number.
