You may hear these words thrown around in other software dev teams if you're not working directly with Gradle, Maven, or Kotlin.

### **Gradle**

- **What it is:** A **build automation tool**.
    
- **Used for:** Compiling code, managing dependencies, running tests, and packaging apps.
    
- **Typical use case:** Especially common in **Java** and **Kotlin** projects.
    
- **In Android Studio?** Yes â€” **Gradle is the default build system** for Android Studio projects.
    
- **Compare with Maven:**
    - **Maven** is another popular Java build tool (older than Gradle).
    - Gradle is considered **faster and more flexible** than Maven.
    - Maven uses XML configuration; Gradle uses Groovy or Kotlin DSLs.
