If you use OpenCV to create videos with python and you need to be notified when the file is done, there are some gotchas.

There is asynchronous nature of file writing and processing in Python, particularly with OpenCV's `VideoWriter`. When `out.release()` is called, it signals the end of the video writing process, but there might be a delay before the file is completely written and closed, especially for larger files. This can result in the file appearing incomplete or unplayable immediately after the script finishes.

To ensure that your script waits until the file is fully processed and closed, you can implement a waiting mechanism. Here's how you can modify your script to include such a mechanism:

1. **Use a File Checking Loop**: After calling `out.release()`, you can implement a loop that periodically checks if the file is accessible and fully written. This can be done using the `os` module to check the file's size over a short period, ensuring it's no longer changing, which would indicate that writing has completed.

2. **Implement a Timeout**: To prevent the loop from running indefinitely in case of errors, you should also implement a timeout mechanism.

Here's an example of how you can integrate this into your `create_video` function:

```python
import time

def create_video(images, durations, output_path):
    # Existing code to create the video...

    out.release()

    # Wait for the file to be fully written
    max_wait_time = 60  # Maximum time to wait in seconds
    start_time = time.time()
    previous_size = -1
    current_size = os.path.getsize(output_path)

    while current_size != previous_size and time.time() - start_time < max_wait_time:
        previous_size = current_size
        time.sleep(1)  # Wait for 1 second before checking the file size again
        current_size = os.path.getsize(output_path)

    if time.time() - start_time >= max_wait_time:
        print("Warning: Reached timeout while waiting for the video file to be fully written.")
    else:
        print("Video file has been successfully written and closed.")

    return output_path
```

In this modified function, after `out.release()` is called, the script enters a loop where it checks the file size every second. If the file size hasn't changed for a second, it's likely that the file has been fully written. The loop will exit either when the file is complete or when the maximum wait time is reached.

Remember to adjust `max_wait_time` according to your needs. If you're working with very large video files, you might need to increase this value.
