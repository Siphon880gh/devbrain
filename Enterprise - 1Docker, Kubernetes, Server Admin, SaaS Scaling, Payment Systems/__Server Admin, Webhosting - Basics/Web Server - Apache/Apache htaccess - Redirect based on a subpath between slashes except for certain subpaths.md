htaccess directing based on a subpath between slashes except for certain subpaths

To make the `RewriteRule` work for any name other than `workouts-player`, you would use a regular expression to capture any sequence of characters except for the specific string `workouts-player`. Here's how you can do it:

```apache
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/tool/workouts-player$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/app/workouts-player$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/apps/workouts-player$
RewriteRule ^tool/([^/]+)$ /tools/$1 [R=301,L]
RewriteRule ^app/([^/]+)$ /tools/$1 [R=301,L]
RewriteRule ^apps/([^/]+)$ /tools/$1 [R=301,L]
```

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

1. The `RewriteCond` directives are used to ensure the URL does not match `workouts-player` for each of the specified directories (`tool/`, `app/`, `apps/`).
2. In the `RewriteRule`, `([^/]+)` is a regular expression that captures one or more characters that are not a forward slash (`/`). This will match any name.
3. `$1` in the replacement part of the `RewriteRule` refers to the captured value from the regular expression, effectively preserving the original name in the redirected URL.

This setup will redirect any name (other than `workouts-player`) from the specified directories to the `tools/` directory.
