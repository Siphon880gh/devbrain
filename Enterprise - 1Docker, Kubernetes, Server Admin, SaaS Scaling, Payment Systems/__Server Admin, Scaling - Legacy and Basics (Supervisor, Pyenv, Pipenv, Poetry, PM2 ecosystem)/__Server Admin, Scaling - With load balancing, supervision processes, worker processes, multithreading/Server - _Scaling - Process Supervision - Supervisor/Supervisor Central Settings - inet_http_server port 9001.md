Yes, port 9001 is commonly used as the web interface for Supervisor, allowing you to access a graphical user interface (GUI) through a web browser. This interface provides an easy way to monitor and manage processes controlled by Supervisor.

To access the Supervisor web interface, you would:

1. Ensure Supervisor is configured to serve the web interface by setting up the `inet_http_server` section in the `supervisord.conf` file:

```
   [inet_http_server]
   port=127.0.0.1:9001
```

2. Start or restart Supervisor to apply the configuration changes:

   ```bash
   sudo supervisorctl reread
   sudo supervisorctl update
   sudo supervisorctl restart all
   ```

3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:9001`. 

If everything is configured correctly, you should see the Supervisor web interface, where you can:

- View the status of all processes managed by Supervisor.
- Start, stop, or restart individual processes.
- View logs for each process.
- Perform other management tasks.

This interface makes it much easier to manage processes compared to using command-line tools alone.

BUT that requires you to open the webpage in the local machine


For remote access you need to bind 

```
[inet_http_server]
port=127.0.0.1:9001
username=your_username     ; Optional: add for basic authentication
password=your_password     ; Optional: add for basic authentication
```
