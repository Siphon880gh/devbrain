Your computer can support hardware virtualization but you want to know if it can support the most performant type of hardware virtualization: kmv

The `kvm-ok` command is part of the `cpu-checker` package, which is used to check if your CPU supports hardware virtualization and if it is enabled in the BIOS/UEFI. You can install this package on Ubuntu using the following steps:

1. **Install `cpu-checker` package**:
   First, you need to install the `cpu-checker` package which includes the `kmv-ok` cli tool.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install cpu-checker
   ```

2. **Run `kvm-ok`**:
   After installing the package, you can use the `kvm-ok` command to check if hardware virtualization is supported and enabled.

   ```bash
   kvm-ok
   ```

   This command will provide output indicating whether your CPU supports hardware virtualization and if it is enabled.

If you see a message saying "KVM acceleration can be used", it means your hardware supports virtualization and it is enabled in the BIOS. If you see a message saying "KVM acceleration cannot be used", it means either your CPU does not support virtualization or it is not enabled in the BIOS.

Here's an example of what the output might look like:

```bash
INFO: /dev/kvm exists
KVM acceleration can be used
```

Or if virtualization is not supported or enabled:

```bash
INFO: Your CPU does not support KVM extensions
KVM acceleration can NOT be used
```

In that case, you can still run virtual machines, either through OS virtualization or other types of hardware virtualization (if you detected hardware virtualization is supported by your CPU) but it'll be much slower without the KVM extensions.

If you see the message "KVM acceleration can/can NOT be used" - that is misleading; It means if KVM is currently turned on, not whether itâ€™s supported.

By using `kvm-ok`, you can quickly determine the status of hardware virtualization support on your system. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

## Reworded, Other ways to check for KVM

The `xl info` command in Xen does not specifically show KVM capabilities because KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a different hypervisor technology that is part of the Linux kernel. Xen and KVM are separate virtualization technologies and do not typically interact directly with each other.

If you want to check if your system supports KVM, you should use tools and commands related to KVM. Here are some methods to verify KVM support on your system:

### Check KVM Support

1. **Check CPU Flags**:
   Ensure that the virtualization extensions (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) are present in your CPU.

   ```bash
   grep -E 'vmx|svm' /proc/cpuinfo
   ```

   - `vmx` indicates Intel VT-x support.
   - `svm` indicates AMD-V support.

2. **Using `lscpu`**:
   Use the `lscpu` command to check for virtualization support.

   ```bash
   lscpu | grep Virtualization
   ```

   This command should show `VT-x` for Intel or `AMD-V` for AMD if hardware virtualization is supported.

3. **Install `cpu-checker`**:
   Install the `cpu-checker` package and use the `kvm-ok` command to verify KVM support.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install cpu-checker
   kvm-ok
   ```

   The `kvm-ok` command will output whether KVM can be used.

4. **Check for KVM Modules**:
   Verify that the KVM kernel modules are loaded.

   ```bash
   lsmod | grep kvm
   ```

   You should see `kvm` and either `kvm_intel` (for Intel CPUs) or `kvm_amd` (for AMD CPUs) listed.

5. **Check dmesg Logs**:
   Look at the kernel messages to ensure that KVM is being used.

   ```bash
   dmesg | grep -i kvm
   ```

### Example Output

For `kvm-ok`, you might see:
```bash
INFO: /dev/kvm exists
KVM acceleration can be used
```

For `lscpu | grep Virtualization`, you might see:
```bash
Virtualization: VT-x
```

By following these steps, you can verify if your system supports KVM and if KVM can be used. If you have further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

Yes, it is possible for a system to support hardware virtualization without supporting KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). KVM is just one of several virtualization technologies that utilize hardware virtualization extensions. Here are a few scenarios where hardware virtualization is supported but KVM is not used:

1. **Other Hypervisors**:
    
    - **Xen**: Xen is a popular hypervisor that uses hardware virtualization extensions (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) but does not use KVM. Xen operates at a lower level than KVM and can run both paravirtualized and fully virtualized guests.
    - **VMware ESXi**: VMware's hypervisor also uses hardware virtualization extensions without relying on KVM.
    - **Microsoft Hyper-V**: This is another hypervisor that uses hardware virtualization features but is distinct from KVM.
2. **Bare-Metal Hypervisors**:
    
    - Hypervisors like VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V are examples of bare-metal hypervisors that directly interface with hardware without needing a host operating system like Linux (which KVM requires).
3. **Alternative Virtualization Solutions**:
    
    - **VirtualBox**: While primarily a hosted hypervisor, VirtualBox can use hardware virtualization extensions (VT-x/AMD-V) but does not depend on KVM.
    - **Parallels**: Parallels Desktop for Mac uses hardware virtualization extensions but does not utilize KVM.
4. **BIOS/UEFI Settings**:
    
    - Your BIOS/UEFI might have virtualization support enabled, but the kernel or hypervisor software you are using does not utilize KVM. This is typical when running non-Linux-based hypervisors or when KVM modules are not loaded.
