The Linux cat command displays the contents of a file. The tail command displays the last few lines of a file.

The cat command is useful for viewing the entire contents of a file. 

```
cat example.txt
```

You can also use the `cat` command to concatenate multiple files and display their contents. For example, if you have two files, `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`, and you want to concatenate and display their contents:

```
cat file1.txt file2.txt
```

Cat's namesake:
The name "cat" for the command in Unix-like operating systems stands for "concatenate." The `cat` command was originally designed to concatenate and display the contents of one or more files. Its primary purpose was to combine the contents of multiple files and write them to a single output stream or display them on the terminal.

Over time, the `cat` command evolved to have additional functionalities beyond just concatenation, such as displaying the contents of a single file, creating new files, or appending content to existing files, but its name "cat" remained from its original purpose.

The tail command is useful for viewing the last few lines of a file, which can be useful for viewing logs if logs are appended on writing. Once you view the tail lines, you can see if the dates get newer and newer as you go down to confirm if tail is the right approach.

```
tail -n 20 myapp.log
```

If you want to continuously monitor a log file as new lines are added to it (e.g., for real-time log monitoring), you can use the `-f` option with `tail` like this:

```
tail -f myapp.log
```

This will display the last few lines of the file and continue to update in real-time as new lines are appended to the log file. You can exit this real-time monitoring mode by pressing `Ctrl + C`.

The Linux `head` command is used to display the beginning or the first few lines of a file. It is the counterpart to the `tail` command, which displays the last few lines of a file. The `head` command is useful when you want to quickly preview the content at the beginning of a file without displaying the entire file. By default, it displays the first 10 lines of a file, but you can specify a different number of lines using the `-n` option. For example, to display the first 20 lines of a file, you can use the following command:

```
head -n 20 filename
```
