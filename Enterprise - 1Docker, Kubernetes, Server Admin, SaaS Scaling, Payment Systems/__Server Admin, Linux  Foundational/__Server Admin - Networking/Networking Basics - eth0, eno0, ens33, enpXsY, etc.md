## Old vs New

Eg. In older Linux distributions or in certain environments, the network interface that is called `eno2` on your current system might have been named `eth1` instead. 
### Naming Conventions:

- **`ethX` Naming:**

   - **Traditional Naming:** Older versions of Linux used `eth0`, `eth1`, etc., to name Ethernet interfaces in the order they were detected by the system.

   - **Consistency Issues:** This naming could change depending on the order in which devices were detected at boot, leading to inconsistencies, especially in systems with multiple network interfaces.

- ** `enoX` and `enpXsY` Naming:**

   - **Predictable Network Interface Names:** Modern Linux distributions, including recent versions of Debian and Ubuntu, have moved to a more predictable naming convention like `enpXsY`, `enoX`, etc., where:

     - `en` stands for Ethernet.
     - `pX` indicates the PCI bus number.
     - `sY` indicates the slot number on the bus.
     - `enoX` typically indicates onboard Ethernet devices.

   - **Stability:** These names are stable and don't change based on device detection order, which improves consistency across reboots and hardware changes.
   
- Depends on older vs newer Linux: So, in environments or systems that still use the older naming convention, your `eno2` interface might indeed have been referred to as `eth1`.

## enoX Naming

The enoX naming convention, where X is a number, typically indicates an onboard Ethernet interface rather than a specific port number, with the 'o' meaning onboard. Here's what it means:

enoX Naming Convention:
- en stands for Ethernet.
- o indicates that the interface is onboard (i.e., integrated into the motherboard).
- X is a number that represents the specific onboard Ethernet interface.

Understanding enoX:

- X Numbering: The X in enoX is usually assigned based on the order in which the onboard Ethernet interfaces are detected by the system. For example:
	- eno1 might be the first onboard Ethernet interface.
	- eno2 might be the second onboard Ethernet interface, and so on.

Onboard Interfaces: These are network interfaces that are built into the motherboard rather than being add-on PCI or USB network cards.

Ports vs. Interfaces:
- Port Numbering: The X in enoX does not directly correspond to a physical port number on the network interface card (NIC). It refers to the order of the interfaces as recognized by the operating system.
- Multiple Ports: If a NIC has multiple physical ports, they might be named eno1, eno2, etc., but this naming depends on how the system identifies and orders them, not necessarily the physical layout on the card.

Summary:
enoX identifies onboard Ethernet interfaces in a predictable manner, with X being a sequential number assigned based on the detection order of these interfaces. It does not directly represent a port number but rather the interface's position as recognized by the system.

## Case Study: ens33

The `ens33` naming convention follows the **predictable network interface names** system introduced in modern Linux distributions. Here's a breakdown of what `ens33` means:

### **`ens33` Naming Convention:**
- **`en`** stands for **Ethernet**.
- **`s`** indicates that the interface is connected to a specific slot (typically a PCI slot).
- **`33`** is a number that represents a specific interface, usually based on its location within the system's hardware topology.

### **Understanding `ens33`:**

- **Predictable Naming:** The `ens33` name is intended to be more predictable than the older `ethX` naming convention. It ensures that the network interface names remain consistent across reboots and hardware changes.

- **PCI Slot-Based Naming:**

  - `s33` typically refers to the slot or path on the PCI bus where the network interface is located.

  - The numbering (`33` in this case) reflects the order or a specific identifier for that network device within the system.


### **Comparison to Other Naming Conventions:**

- **`ethX` (e.g., `eth0`, `eth1`)**: The traditional naming based on the order of detection.

- **`ensX` (e.g., `ens33`)**: A more stable and predictable name tied to the physical or logical location of the network interface.

- **`enpXsY` (e.g., `enp3s0`)**: Another common naming scheme where `pX` refers to the PCI bus number and `sY` refers to the slot number on that bus.

### **Summary:**

`ens33` refers to an Ethernet interface that is likely associated with a specific slot or position on the PCI bus. The name is part of the modern, predictable network interface naming system, which provides more consistent and stable naming for network interfaces across reboots and hardware changes.
