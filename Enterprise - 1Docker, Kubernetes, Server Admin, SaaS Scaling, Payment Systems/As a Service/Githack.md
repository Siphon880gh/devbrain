**CDN vs Development Links**
During development, when traffic is low and freshness is more important than performance, use development URLs. For anything you share with the public or push to production, use CDN URLs.

**Can I use a development URL on a production website?**
No. Please use CDN URLs for anything that might result in heavy traffic. Only use development URLs for low-traffic testing and sharing temporary examples or demos during development. When people misuse the service, it costs me money. Please don't be a jerk.
