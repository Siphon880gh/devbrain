### ✅ Getting Started with C# WinForms

1. **Install Visual Studio**  
    Download and install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (Community Edition is free). During installation:
    
    - Select the **“.NET Desktop Development”** workload.
        
2. **Create a WinForms Project**
    
    - Open Visual Studio.
        
    - Go to **File → New → Project**.
        
    - Select **Windows Forms App (.NET Framework)** or **Windows Forms App (.NET Core/.NET 6/7)** depending on your setup.
        
    - Name your project and click **Create**.
        
3. **Understand the Designer**
    
    - You’ll see a visual designer to drag and drop controls like buttons, textboxes, etc.
        
    - Click on a control to modify properties in the right-hand pane.
        
4. **Write Code**
    
    - Double-click a control (like a button) to add an event handler in code (e.g., `button1_Click`).
        
    - Write C# logic in these event handlers.
        
5. **Run Your App**
    
    - Press **F5** or click the **Start** button to run your app.
