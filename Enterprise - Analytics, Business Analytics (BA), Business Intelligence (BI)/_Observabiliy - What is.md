## What is Observability

**Observability** refers to the ability to monitor, analyze, and understand the health, performance, and behavior of applications, infrastructure, and services in real-time. It involves gathering and interpreting data from various systems to provide a complete view of their status and performance.

**Key components of observability** in web and cloud applications include:

1. **Metrics** – Quantitative data points like CPU usage, memory consumption, request rates, error rates, and response times.
  
2. **Logs** – Recorded events from applications and infrastructure, which provide context about specific events, errors, and operational flows.
  
3. **Traces** – A way to follow a request or transaction as it moves through various services and systems, identifying bottlenecks or failures in complex architectures.

**Purpose of Observability:**
- **Proactive Monitoring** – Catch issues before they impact users by setting up alerts on performance thresholds.
- **Troubleshooting** – Diagnose and resolve issues quickly by pinpointing where and why errors occur.
- **Performance Optimization** – Ensure efficient resource utilization, load balancing, and smooth scaling.
- **User Experience Insight** – Understand the real impact of system health on the end-user experience, allowing for improved application responsiveness and reliability.

**Examples**:
- **Frontend Observability:** Get actionable insights into the end-user experience of web applications by monitoring real-time frontend health and errors.
- **Infrastructure Observability:** Track Kubernetes and other infrastructure to detect unexpected workload increases, optimize performance, manage load balancing, and reduce the risk of server crashes.

**In Practice:** Observability tools, like Grafana, Kibana, and Prometheus, aggregate and visualize this data to provide a coherent, centralized view of application and infrastructure health, helping teams make informed decisions and maintain high service quality.

Note: This is unrelated to ObservableHQ (https://observablehq.com/), which is a platform for building data apps with a simplified syntax API.

## Observability & Business Intelligence

Observability and business intelligence (BI) intersect through their shared goal of providing data-driven insights that can guide decision-making, especially in cost management. Observability can help control cloud costs by optimizing server use and avoiding inefficiencies, like unnecessary server pings that drive up expenses.

When observability identifies and reduces performance bottlenecks or highlights underutilized resources, it supports BI efforts to control operating costs, improve efficiency, and ultimately maximize return on investment. With BI analytics, this observability data can be further used to forecast resource needs and improve cost allocation, helping businesses to plan for optimized, demand-driven resource allocation and efficient cloud spending.
