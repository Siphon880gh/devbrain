You want a live dashboard of totals and bar charts so you can have a quick snapshot look into your users/customers. Let's say we have an app serving real estate related professions and organizations and because they're using our app we have the data in MongoDB. MetaBase looks into MongoDB and condenses the data onto one page and it's live.
