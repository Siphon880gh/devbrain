**Audience:**
* Business users, decision makers, executives, analysts
* Often **non-technical**

**Focus:**
* What happened?
* Why did it happen?

**Tools:**
* Dashboards, charts, KPI reports
* Drag-and-drop interfaces
* SQL-based querying (optional)

**Skills Needed:**
* Low to moderate technical skill
* Some may need to know SQL, but often tools like **Metabase**, **Power BI**, or **Tableau** simplify it

<center>üìä **Business Analytics (BA)**</center>
<hr/>

**Audience:**
* Data analysts, data scientists, statisticians
* **More technical, math-savvy users**

**Focus:**
* What will happen? (predictive)
* What should we do? (prescriptive)

**Tools:**
* Python, R, SAS, Jupyter, advanced Excel, etc.
* Statistical modeling, forecasting, machine learning

**Skills Needed:**
* Strong math, statistics, programming
* Understand regression, clustering, time-series analysis, etc.

## Metabase

### ‚úÖ Metabase fits into:

- **Business Intelligence (BI)** because it:
    - Connects to databases and visualizes data
    - Creates dashboards and reports
    - Supports SQL and no-code queries for business users
    - Focuses on understanding what happened and why (descriptive and diagnostic analytics)
### üö´ Metabase does **not** do:

- Predictive analytics
- Machine learning modeling
- Prescriptive analytics (e.g., optimization)

So: **Metabase = Business Intelligence tool** (with light analytics capabilities).
