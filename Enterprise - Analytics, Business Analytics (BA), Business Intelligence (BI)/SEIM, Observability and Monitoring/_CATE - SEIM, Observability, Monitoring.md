Here's a brief, clear explanation of each term:
### 1. **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**:

- **What it does**: Collects, analyzes, and correlates logs and security events from various systems to detect, alert, and respond to security threats.
    
- **Purpose**: Enhances cybersecurity, compliance, and incident response.
    
- **Example**: Splunk, Elastic Security, IBM QRadar.

### 3. **Monitoring**:

- **What it does**: Continuously tracks system metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, availability) to alert on known issues or thresholds.
    
- **Purpose**: Early detection of outages, performance degradation, or infrastructure issues.
    
- **Example**: Nagios, Prometheus, Zabbix.

**In Short**:

- **SIEM** focuses on **security threats**.
- **Observability** provides **deep system insights**.
- **Monitoring** alerts on predefined **performance thresholds or outages**.
