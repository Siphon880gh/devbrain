There are three levels that can be attacked from:
- Enterprise, Mobile, and ICS (Industrial Control Systems)
- ICS stands the industrial type interfaces like workstations (operator controls), PLC, DCS, Sensors and actuators, field devices (power plants), etc

The MITRE ATT&CK Navigator is a free, web-based tool designed to help cybersecurity professionals visualize and analyze adversary behaviors using the MITRE ATT&CK framework. It provides an interactive interface for mapping, annotating, and comparing attack techniques and tactics across different threat actors, environments, and defensive strategies.([Exabeam](https://www.exabeam.com/explainers/mitre-attck/mitre-attck-navigator-use-cases-layers-and-how-to-get-started/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "MITRE ATT&CK Navigator: Use Cases, Layers, and How to Get ..."), [Xcitium](https://www.xcitium.com/mitre-attack-navigator/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How To Use Mitre Attack Navigator? | MITRE ATT&CK Analysis"))

### üîç Key Features

- **Interactive Matrix**: Offers a visual representation of the ATT&CK matrix, allowing users to explore tactics and techniques used by adversaries.
- **Custom Layers**: Users can create and manage layers to focus on specific aspects, such as particular threat actors or security assessments.
- **Annotations**: Supports adding comments, color codes, and scores to techniques for better analysis and communication.
- **Import/Export Functionality**: Enables sharing and collaboration by allowing layers to be imported and exported in JSON format.([GitHub](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-navigator?utm_source=chatgpt.com "mitre-attack/attack-navigator: Web app that provides basic ... - GitHub"), [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/docs/training-cti/Comparing%20Layers%20in%20Navigator.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Comparing Layers in ATT&CK Navigator"))
    

### üõ†Ô∏è Use Cases

- **Threat Intelligence**: Map known adversary behaviors to understand potential threats and tailor defenses accordingly.
- **Security Assessments**: Evaluate existing security measures by identifying coverage gaps in detection and response capabilities.
- **Red/Blue Team Exercises**: Plan and document simulated attack scenarios to test organizational defenses and improve incident response.([Exabeam](https://www.exabeam.com/explainers/mitre-attck/mitre-attck-navigator-use-cases-layers-and-how-to-get-started/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "MITRE ATT&CK Navigator: Use Cases, Layers, and How to Get ..."), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/zl6qiq/has_anyone_used_the_mitre_attck_navigator_to/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Has anyone used the MITRE ATT&CK Navigator to start Threat ..."), [Picus Security](https://www.picussecurity.com/resource/glossary/what-is-mitre-attack?utm_source=chatgpt.com "What Is MITRE ATT&CK Framework?
