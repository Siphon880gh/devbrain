### What is CVSS
- **What it is:**
	- A **severity rating system** for CVEs.
	- Designed for scoring vulnerabilities using environmental, temporal, and intrinsic characteristics.
	- Used in tools like the **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)** and Amazon Inspector.
- **Use case:** 
	- Helps prioritize vulnerabilities based on exploitability and impact.
- **Score Range:** 
	- 0.0 (none) to 10.0 (critical)
- **Maintained by:** 
	- FIRST.org
  
> Often paired with CVEs to determine which vulnerabilities need urgent action. Refer to [[__ Compliance - 5. Indexes]]

### Key Metrics in CVSS Scoring

1. **Exploitability Metrics**:
	- **Attack Vector (AV):** How vulnerabilities are exploited (Network, Adjacent, Local, Physical).
	- **Attack Complexity (AC):** How difficult it is to exploit (Low or High).
	- **Privileges Required (PR):** The privileges needed to exploit (None, Low, High).
	- **User Interaction (UI):** Whether attacker needs user activity (Required or None).
3. **Impact Metrics**:
	- **Confidentiality Impact (C):** Loss of confidentiality.
	- **Integrity Impact (I):** Impact on data trustworthiness.
	- **Availability Impact (A):** Effect on system availability.
5. **Scope (S):**
	- **Unchanged:** Impact is within the same security boundary.
	- **Changed:** Impact breaches one security boundary to another.

###  **🔍 CVSS in Context:**

| Term     | Type           | Purpose                                       |
| -------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **CVE**  | Index          | Lists individual known vulnerabilities        |
| **CWE**  | Index          | Lists types of software weaknesses            |
| **CVSS** | Scoring system | Rates severity of vulnerabilities (like CVEs) |
