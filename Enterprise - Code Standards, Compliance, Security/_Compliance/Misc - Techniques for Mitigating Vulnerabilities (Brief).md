### **Techniques for Mitigating Vulnerabilities**

Organizations must go beyond compliance to actively defend against evolving threats. Key mitigation techniques include:

- **Patch Management:** Apply vendor patches and updates without delay.
- **Network Segmentation:** Isolate sensitive systems to reduce potential attacker movement.
- **Vulnerability Scanning & Penetration Testing:** Use tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, and Invicti to identify and address weaknesses.
- **Threat Modeling:** Anticipate threat scenarios to guide defensive planning.
- **Zero Trust Architecture:** Enforce least privilege access across all systems.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Use SIEM solutions to detect and investigate unusual behavior.
