MITRE ATT&K framework starts from three possible layers where there can be attacks:
- Enterprise
- Mobile
- ICS (Industrial Control Systems)

----

## **ICS (Industrial Control Systems)**


These are systems used to **monitor and control physical machines** in places like power plants, factories, water treatment facilities, and other critical infrastructure.

- **Workstations** (like engineering workstations or operator consoles)
- **HMIs (Human-Machine Interfaces)**
- **PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers)**
- **RTUs (Remote Terminal Units)**
- **SCADA Systems** (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)
- **DCS (Distributed Control Systems)**
- **Sensors & Actuators**
- **Field devices** connected to critical infrastructure (e.g., power plants, water treatment, manufacturing lines)

## ICS Breakdown

Here‚Äôs a **layperson-friendly breakdown** of what‚Äôs included in **ICS (Industrial Control Systems)**:

---

### üíª **Workstations**

Computers used by engineers or operators to design, monitor, or control the system.  
‚û°Ô∏è Like the main control computer in a factory control room.

---

### üñ•Ô∏è **HMIs (Human-Machine Interfaces)**

Screens or panels that show how the machines are running and let people interact with them.  
‚û°Ô∏è Think of a dashboard that shows the temperature of a machine and lets you press a button to turn it off.

---

### üß† **PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers)**

Small industrial computers that **automatically control machines** based on programmed rules.  
‚û°Ô∏è Like a brain that turns a pump on if the water level gets too low.

---

### üåê **RTUs (Remote Terminal Units)**

Devices that collect data and control equipment **in faraway locations**, often over radio or cellular.  
‚û°Ô∏è Used to monitor pipelines or remote water tanks without needing someone there.

---

### üõ∞Ô∏è **SCADA Systems (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)**

Software that pulls data from many devices and shows it in one place for operators to monitor and control.  
‚û°Ô∏è Like a central command center for all the machines spread across a city or region.

---

### üè≠ **DCS (Distributed Control Systems)**

Similar to SCADA but often used **within one facility**, like a large factory, to handle **complex, real-time control**.  
‚û°Ô∏è Like an advanced internal control system for one plant.

---

### üìü **Sensors & Actuators**

- **Sensors** detect things like temperature, pressure, or flow.
    
- **Actuators** make things move, like turning valves or starting motors.  
    ‚û°Ô∏è Eyes and hands of the system.
    

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Field Devices**

The physical equipment doing the real-world work ‚Äî pumps, motors, valves ‚Äî all connected to the system.  
‚û°Ô∏è They move the water, generate electricity, or run machines.
