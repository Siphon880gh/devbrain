### ✅ **What is this document about?**

It defines the **minimum required security and privacy controls** for **TxDOT** (Texas Department of Transportation) information systems that **process, store, transmit, or maintain** TxDOT data. It is based primarily on **NIST SP 800-53r5** but tailored for TxDOT’s specific operational environment and Texas state-level requirements.

It ensures:

- Compliance with federal and state regulations.
- Proper handling of sensitive TxDOT data.
- Alignment with security standards for audit and operational readiness.

### ✅ **Who uses it?**

1. **TxDOT Information Owners & Custodians** – To understand what controls apply to the systems they manage.
2. **Compliance Teams** – To verify adherence to state and federal control requirements.
3. **Security Officers (e.g., CISOs)** – To implement tailored controls and apply overlays.
4. **System Architects / IT Teams** – To design systems in line with required security controls.
5. **Auditors / Assessors** – To check compliance and risk posture against defined baselines.

### ✅ **How do you use it?**

1. **Determine Applicability**:
    - If your system **handles TxDOT data**, this catalog applies.
2. **Review Control Requirements**:
    - Controls are based on **NIST SP 800-53r5** and **state-specific laws (DIR)**.
    - Tailored controls may override or enhance federal baselines.
3. **Use It Like a Compliance Map**:
    - Apply required controls depending on your **system categorization** (Low/Moderate/High) and **data classification**.
    - Refer to the catalog when writing internal policies, configuring systems, or performing assessments.
4. **Follow Updates (like in this version)**:
    - Example: CA-06 "Authorization" was added to minimally assessed controls.
    - RA-05 had its TX-RAMP and FedRAMP references corrected.
