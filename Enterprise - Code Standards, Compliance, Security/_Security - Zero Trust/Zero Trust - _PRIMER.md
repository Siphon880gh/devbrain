## 🔐 Zero Trust: Overview

**Zero Trust** is a cybersecurity model built on the principle: **“Never trust, always verify.”**  
It assumes that **breaches are inevitable**, and therefore **requires strict, continuous validation** of every user, device, and application attempting access.

Key focus areas include:  
✅ Identity verification  
✅ Least-privilege access  
✅ Continuous monitoring

## ⚙️ Core Principles

1. **🔍 Verify Explicitly**
    
    - Always authenticate users/devices using **MFA**, health checks, geolocation, etc.
        
    - Trust must be earned at every step.
        
2. **🔐 Least-Privilege Access**
    
    - Only grant what’s absolutely needed.
        
    - Use **Just-In-Time (JIT)** access to reduce exposure windows.
        
3. **🚨 Assume Breach**
    
    - Design systems as if threats are already inside.
        
    - Use segmentation to limit movement.
        
    - Monitor all activity continuously.

## 🔁 Zero Trust vs. Traditional Security

|**Zero Trust**|**Traditional Security**|
|---|---|
|Assumes internal **and** external threats|Assumes threats are **external** only|
|Verifies users/devices **continuously**|Verifies once — often only at login|
|Identity- and data-focused segmentation|Perimeter-focused (firewalls, VPNs)|
|Continuous real-time monitoring|Limited or no ongoing session monitoring|

## 🧩 Components of Zero Trust

1. **👤 User & Identity Verification**
    
    - MFA, SSO, identity governance
        
2. **💻 Device Security**
    
    - Enforce policy compliance and patching
        
3. **🧱 Network Segmentation**
    
    - Micro-segmentation to block lateral movement
        
4. **📁 Data Protection**
    
    - Encryption (in transit & at rest), access based on data classification
        
5. **🛡️ Application Security**
    
    - Runtime protection (RASP), anomaly detection
        
6. **📊 Continuous Monitoring**
    
    - SIEM, EDR, XDR for real-time threat detection and response

## ✅ Benefits

- **Stronger Security:**  
    Mitigates insider & external threats
    
- **Regulatory Compliance:**  
    Aligns with HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR, etc.
    
- **Supports Modern Workforces:**  
    BYOD, cloud apps, remote access
    
- **Damage Control:**  
    Segmentation reduces attack blast radius

## 🛠️ Key Technologies

- **IAM (Identity & Access Management):**  
    _Examples: Azure AD, Okta, Ping Identity_
    
- **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**
    
- **EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response):**  
    _Examples: CrowdStrike, Microsoft Defender_
    
- **Network Segmentation Tools:**  
    _Examples: VMware NSX, Zscaler_
    
- **Cloud Security:**  
    _Examples: Palo Alto Prisma Cloud, AWS GuardDuty_

## 🧪 Real-World Use Cases

### 1. **Remote Workforce Access**

Employees working remotely go through:

- MFA + device posture checks
    
- Access limited strictly to necessary tools
    

### 2. **Ransomware Containment**

If an intern’s account is compromised:

- Zero privilege escalation
    
- No lateral movement due to micro-segmentation
    
- Ransomware impact is contained

## 🧭 Summary

Zero Trust is a **modern, identity-driven security model** that:

- Assumes breach by default
    
- Enforces least-privilege, real-time verification
    
- Continuously monitors all activity
    

It’s well-suited for **hybrid work**, **cloud-first infrastructures**, and **compliance-heavy industries**.
