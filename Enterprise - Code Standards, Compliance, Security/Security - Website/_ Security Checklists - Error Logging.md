# üîê Security Checklist for Error Logging

Use this checklist to implement safe, production-ready logging practices that protect against leaks, bloat, and attack vectors.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Logging Level Segregation

### üîπ Frontend (Browser)

-  Use `console.debug()`, `console.info()`, and `console.warn()` **only in development**.
-  In production:
    - Strip or disable all console logs using a bundler/minifier (e.g., Webpack, Terser).
    - Never log sensitive data (e.g., tokens, user info, credentials).
    
### üîπ Backend (Server)

-  Use structured log levels:
    - `debug`: internal diagnostic data.
    - `info`: expected events (e.g., app start, login).
    - `warn`: anomalies that don't break the app.
    - `error`: serious issues that affect functionality.
    - `fatal`: critical errors that could crash the system.
        
-  **Development environment**:
    - Enable all levels (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, etc.).
    - Console logging is acceptable.
        
-  **Production environment**:
    - The levels `error`, and `fatal` should be logged persistently.
    - In production, avoid logging any type of information to stdout unless it's piped to a secured service.
	    - **Why:** In containerized or shared environments, team members such as DevOps engineers, platform operators, or CI/CD contractors may have access to stdout logs through tools like `docker logs`, Kubernetes dashboards, or cloud consoles. Even if they aren't authorized to view sensitive data‚Äîsuch as access tokens or email addresses‚Äîthese logs can unintentionally expose such information. This risk increases when working with short-term contractors or during sensitive periods like offboarding, where sabotage is a concern.
	      
	      While the primary risk is internal overexposure, a compromised system could also give external attackers access to stdout logs, which they could use to escalate privileges or move laterally. Routing logs through a secure, access-controlled logging system helps enforce least privilege, maintain auditability, and reduce the potential impact of a breach.
        
    - **Fatal errors should:**
        
        - Be caught and logged securely.
        - **Notify developers** via email, text, or alerting service.
        - Prevent silent crashes that take down the system.
            
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Use log rotation to **prevent disk overuse**, which could lead to denial-of-service (DoS) or system instability.
        

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Log Output Destination

-  Never expose log files through URLs or web-accessible directories.
    
-  Store logs **outside the web root**, e.g., `/var/log/myapp/` not `/public/logs/`.
    
-  For modern stacks, forward logs to centralized services (e.g., ELK, Fluentd, Sentry, Datadog).
    
-  Use file-based logs only if protected by proper permissions and rotation.
    

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Sensitive Data Redaction

-  Never log:
    
    - Passwords
        
    - API keys or tokens
        
    - Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
        
    - Session identifiers
        
-  Use redaction tools or middleware to mask data before writing.
    

**Example (Node.js):**

```js
JSON.stringify(userData, (key, value) =>
  ['password', 'token'].includes(key) ? '***' : value
);
```

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Log Rotation and Retention

-  Enable log rotation to cap file size and avoid filling up disk (e.g., `logrotate`, `winston-daily-rotate-file`).
    
-  Enforce retention policies (e.g., keep logs for 30‚Äì90 days).
    
-  Compress or archive older logs.
    
-  Automatically purge logs beyond retention limits.
    

‚ö†Ô∏è **Why?** Full disks can cause your system to hang, crash, or stop logging altogether ‚Äî a potential **DoS vector**.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Access Control

-  Restrict who and what services can read/write to log files.
    
-  Set strict file permissions (e.g., `chmod 600`, owned by root or service user).
    
-  Encrypt logs if they might contain sensitive information.
    
-  Prevent tampering or unauthorized access via audit trails.
    

---

## ‚úÖ 6. Crash and Exception Handling

-  Catch unhandled exceptions and unhandled promise rejections.
    
-  Log crash details including:
    
    - Error name/message
        
    - Stack trace
        
    - Timestamp
        
-  Avoid dumping full request/response bodies.
    
-  Trigger alerts for `fatal` or `critical` level logs to notify engineering teams immediately.
    

---

## ‚úÖ 7. Logging Infrastructure Security

-  Ensure the logging server or service is hardened:
    
    - Use a firewall.
        
    - Disable public access.
        
    - Apply security patches.
        
-  Use encrypted transport (TLS) when sending logs remotely.
    
-  Monitor logs for tampering, log floods, or anomalies.
    
-  Set up alerts on unexpected log volume changes (could indicate abuse or attack).
    

---

## ‚úÖ 8. Compliance and Auditing

-  Make sure logging complies with:
    
    - **GDPR** (mask IPs, allow data deletion)
        
    - **HIPAA** (PHI protection)
        
    - **SOC 2**, **PCI-DSS**, or other relevant frameworks
        
-  Maintain audit logs for:
    
    - Access to log files
        
    - Administrative actions
        
-  Regularly review your logging strategy and update policies.
    

---

## ‚úÖ 9. Environment-Specific Logging Behavior

-  Use environment variables or config files to control:
    
    - Log level (`debug` in dev, `warn`/`error` in prod)
        
    - Log destination (console vs file vs remote collector)
        
-  Never assume a one-size-fits-all config for all environments.
    

---

## ‚úÖ 10. Testing and Log Hygiene

-  Simulate failures (e.g., DB down, bad input) and verify:
    
    - Errors are caught and logged.
        
    - Logs do not leak sensitive data.
        
    - Alerts are triggered appropriately.
        
-  Regularly check logs for:
    
    - Verbose or excessive output
        
    - Redundant messages
        
    - Sensitive data that slipped through
        
-  Periodically sanitize old logs if needed (e.g., after GDPR requests).
    

---

## üìå Bonus Tips

- Use structured logs (e.g., JSON) for easier querying and filtering.
    
- Log timestamps in UTC or with clear time zones.
    
- Add request IDs or trace IDs for correlating logs across services.
    
- Use tags (e.g., `user_id`, `route`, `service_name`) to enhance searchability.
