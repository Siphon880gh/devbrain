Let's say you created a central admin panel like at https://admin.example.com that is for your core team to manage users. Here's how to harden the security:

- Dont use common URL patterns like https://admin.example.com . Use less common like https://admin0600.example.com . Less likely for automated bots to detect
- Your robots.txt should disallow scraping
- You may want to double password protect the page. You ask the user for a password, then on the next page, ask for the second password.
