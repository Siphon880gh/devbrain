**Cookies are more vulnerable to CSRF** than tokens sent manually in headers.

---

### 🍪 Why cookies are CSRF-prone:

- **Cookies are sent automatically** with every request to the domain they belong to.
    
- So when a malicious site triggers a request to your app’s domain, the browser **includes the auth cookie** — even if the user didn't intentionally make the request.
    
- This is what enables CSRF.

### 🔐 Why `Authorization: Bearer token` is safer:

- Tokens sent in headers (e.g., via `fetch()` with `Authorization`) **are not automatically included** in cross-site requests.
    
- A malicious site **cannot set custom headers** like `Authorization` from a form or `<img>` tag.
    
- So unless the attacker has JavaScript running on your domain (e.g., via XSS), **they can’t send the token**.

### TL;DR:

|Method|Vulnerable to CSRF?|Why|
|---|---|---|
|**Cookies**|✅ Yes|Sent automatically by browser|
|**Bearer tokens**|❌ Not directly|Must be manually included|

👉 If you **must use cookies** (e.g., for traditional session auth), always use:

- `SameSite=Strict` or `Lax`
- CSRF tokens on state-changing actions (POST, PUT, DELETE)


If using **JWTs or session tokens in headers**, CSRF becomes much less of a concern — but you still need to protect against **XSS** (a type of security vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a trusted website through a comment box, form field, or URL).
