Goal: Relevant vulnerabilities for contact forms that email to you

#### âœ… Key Attack Surface:

> **User input â†’ Server â†’ Email system â†’ Your inbox**

Here are the **core vulnerabilities** in that specific setup:

---

#### 1. **Email Header Injection**

- **Impact**: Attacker adds new recipients (BCC/CC), changes subject, or modifies headers.
- **Cause**: Allowing `\r\n` in fields like name, subject, or email address.

#### ðŸš¨ **What Can Go Wrong (Related Vulnerabilities)**:

1. **Email Spoofing**: Attackers can inject additional headers like `BCC` or `CC` to send copies of the email to third parties, often without the original recipientâ€™s knowledge. This can lead to information leakage or the disclosure of personal data.
    
2. **Spam Relay**: Attackers can exploit the form to send spam emails through your server. If your email system isn't secured, your server could be used to send out large volumes of unwanted email, damaging your domainâ€™s reputation or getting it blacklisted by email service providers.
    
3. **Phishing Amplification**: If attackers can spoof headers such as the `From` or `Subject` fields, phishing emails could appear to come from a trusted source. This makes them much more convincing and increases the likelihood of the recipient falling for a scam.
    
4. **Log Poisoning**: If an attacker can inject headers or bodies into the email that are logged by the server, it could corrupt your email logs, making them unreliable. This could mislead system administrators and analysts who depend on logs for monitoring and troubleshooting.
    
5. **SMTP Command Injection** _(in rare setups)_: In certain poorly configured systems, user input could reach the **SMTP protocol layer** directly. If an attacker can inject SMTP commands (like `MAIL FROM`, `RCPT TO`, `DATA`), it could enable them to send emails as though they were a trusted user, or even perform actions like command execution.
    

#### âœ… **Best Practices to Prevent It**:

- **Sanitize and validate input**: Ensure fields like `To`, `Subject`, `From`, etc., do not contain `\r`, `\n`, or other control characters, which could allow attackers to inject headers or break the email format.
    
- **Use email libraries** that enforce header encoding and field validation. Many well-established libraries such as Pythonâ€™s `email.message`, Nodeâ€™s `nodemailer`, or PHPâ€™s `PHPMailer` automatically handle these issues and sanitize input before it reaches the email system.
    
- **Restrict user-modifiable fields**: If possible, limit or remove user input from sensitive header fields like `To`, `From`, or `Subject`. Only allow these fields to be populated by the backend or trusted systems.
    
- **Escape input safely**: If you must include user-provided data in header fields, make sure itâ€™s properly escaped. This ensures that special characters (like `\r`, `\n`, or other control characters) are not interpreted as headers but as literal content.

#### 2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** _(Only if echoing back input in a confirmation page or email preview)_

- **Impact**: Malicious JavaScript runs in your browser if input is reflected unsanitized.
    
- **Cause**: Echoing raw input on success pages or in HTML emails.
    
- **Mitigation**: Escape output properly; sanitize HTML or use plain text for email bodies.

---

#### 3. **Spam and Bot Abuse**

- **Impact**: Your inbox fills with junk messages or gets flagged as a spam target.
    
- **Cause**: No CAPTCHA, honeypot, or rate limiting.
    
- **Mitigation**: Use CAPTCHA, honeypot fields, and throttle IP-based submissions.

---

#### 4. **Denial of Service (DoS) via Form Flooding**

- **Impact**: Server/email system overwhelmed.
    
- **Cause**: No rate limiting or IP blacklisting.
    
- **Mitigation**: Throttle submissions per IP, use a Web Application Firewall (WAF).

---

#### 5. **Sensitive Data Leakage**

- **Impact**: Accidental exposure of user messages.
    
- **Cause**: Forwarding emails through insecure channels or including too much request metadata.
    
- **Mitigation**: Use HTTPS, donâ€™t include unnecessary metadata, and encrypt sensitive data if necessary.

---

#### 6. **Malicious Content in Emails**

- **Impact**: You open emails with embedded scripts, links, or potentially dangerous attachments.
    
- **Cause**: Including raw user input in HTML-formatted emails.
    
- **Mitigation**: Sanitize input, especially for name/message fields. Consider sending emails in plain text.

---

#### Optional (less common) vulnerabilities in email-only forms:

- **CSRF**: Low risk if unauthenticated, but still worth preventing to block automated submissions from elsewhere.
    
- **Open Email Relaying**: If using a misconfigured SMTP server, your server might be abused to send arbitrary emails.

---

### To summarize:

By addressing **Email Header Injection** properly, you protect against a variety of potential threats, including **email spoofing**, **spam relay**, **phishing**, and even more serious issues like **SMTP command injection**. It's vital to sanitize and validate all user input, especially when dealing with email headers, and ensure that your system is secure against these potential attacks.
