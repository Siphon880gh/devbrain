### Provide a `.env.example` File
- Include a `.env.example` file in your repo with placeholder values to help new team members set up their local environment quickly.
- Never commit your actual `.env` file to Gitâ€”keep real secrets out of version control.
- This approach ensures secure practices while making onboarding and configuration easier.
