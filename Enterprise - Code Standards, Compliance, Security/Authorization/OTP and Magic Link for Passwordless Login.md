# 🔑 OTP vs. Magic Link: Which Passwordless Login is Better?

Modern apps often move beyond passwords for better security and user experience. Two popular methods are:

- **OTP (One-Time Password)** — typically a short code
    
- **Magic Link** — a time-limited URL sent via email
    

Both fall under **passwordless authentication**, but serve different use cases. Here’s how they compare.

## 📲 What is an OTP?

An **OTP** is a short, single-use code sent via:

- **SMS**
    
- **Email**
    
- **Authenticator app (TOTP)**
    

The user enters the code to verify their identity. Examples:

- `Email: "Your code is 472819"`
    
- `SMS: "Enter 895622 to log in"`

## 🔗 What is a Magic Link?

A **Magic Link** is a one-time URL sent to the user's email. When clicked:

- It logs the user in automatically
    
- It often expires in minutes or after one use
    

Example:

> "Click to log in: [https://example.com/auth/magic?token=abc123](https://example.com/auth/magic?token=abc123)"

No password, no code — just click and you're in.

## ✅ Pros & Cons

### OTP Pros

- Familiar to users
    
- Works with phone or email
    
- TOTP (e.g., via Authenticator apps) works offline
    

### OTP Cons

- Can be intercepted (especially SMS)
    
- Annoying to type and prone to input errors
    

---

### Magic Link Pros

- Seamless login — no typing
    
- Great for casual or low-risk apps
    
- No password = fewer breaches
    

### Magic Link Cons

- Must access email on the same device or browser
    
- Risky if email is compromised
    
- Not ideal for mobile-only users with slow email apps

## 🧠 When to Use Each

|Use Case|Recommended Method|
|---|---|
|Secure enterprise login|OTP with TOTP or Push|
|Consumer-facing mobile apps|OTP via SMS/email|
|Frictionless SaaS app login|Magic Link|
|One-time access for low-risk|Magic Link|
|Authenticator-based 2FA|OTP (TOTP)|
|Low-friction signup or re-entry|Magic Link|

## 🔐 Bonus Tip: Combine Them

Some platforms offer both:

> First send a **Magic Link**, but if it’s not clicked, fall back to an **OTP code**.

This gives users choice and reduces login abandonment.

---

## 🧩 Final Thoughts

- **Magic Links** are great for speed and user-friendliness.
    
- **OTPs** are versatile and more flexible for different channels.
    
- Avoid **SMS OTP for critical apps** — use app-based codes or passkeys where possible.
    

Both improve on traditional passwords — the choice depends on user base, security needs, and flow.
