Note: SAML is actually **not an authorization flow**, but rather an **authentication protocol** that SSO, which is an authorization flow, uses.

### üîë What is SAML?

**SAML** stands for **Security Assertion Markup Language**. It is an **XML-based authentication protocol** used primarily for **Single Sign-On (SSO)** in enterprise environments.

* ‚úÖ **Purpose**: To allow users to authenticate once (e.g. with a company‚Äôs Identity Provider like Okta or Azure AD) and then access multiple apps (called Service Providers) without logging in again.
* ‚úÖ **Used For**: Authentication
* ‚ùå **Not Used For**: Fine-grained authorization (e.g. RBAC, scopes, roles)

### üîÅ How SAML Works (Simplified Flow)

1. **User clicks ‚ÄúLogin with SSO‚Äù** on a service provider (e.g., Salesforce).
2. **Service Provider** redirects the user to their **Identity Provider** (e.g., Okta).
3. User logs in to the Identity Provider.
4. The Identity Provider sends a **SAML Assertion** (proof of identity) back to the Service Provider.
5. The Service Provider grants access based on the assertion.

### ‚úÖ SAML vs OAuth2 vs OpenID Connect

| **Protocol**       | **Use Case**                   | **Handles Auth?**  | **Handles ID?** | **Commonly Used In**             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------ | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **SAML**           | Enterprise SSO                 | ‚úÖ Yes (login)      | Limited         | Enterprise intranets, SaaS       |
| **OAuth2**         | Authorization                  | ‚ùå (delegates only) | ‚ùå               | API access, delegated permission |
| **OpenID Connect** | Authentication layer on OAuth2 | ‚úÖ Yes              | ‚úÖ Yes           | Web/Mobile login, social auth    |

**TL;DR**:

* SAML = authentication protocol (mainly SSO)
* Not used for authorization (like deciding what a user can do ‚Äî that's RBAC/OAuth scopes)
* Still widely used in enterprises and legacy systems

Let me know if you want a visual flow or a comparison chart between the auth protocols.
