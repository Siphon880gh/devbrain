## Is There a "Right" Way?

In RESTful API design, one of the most surprisingly **contentious debates** is whether to use **singular** or **plural nouns** in route paths. Should it be `/user` or `/users`? Should you stick with one form throughout? Or can you mix them?

---

### 😤 The “Best Practice” You’ll Hear Everywhere

Most RESTful conventions — including from giants like Google and Microsoft — recommend:

- **Plural for collections:**  
    `GET /users`
- **Singular with an ID, but under the plural path:**  
    `GET /users/:id`


This keeps things consistent: "users" is always the base resource, regardless of whether you’re fetching one or many. This is also how it's taught academically.

### 🧠 But Here’s a Thought: What If We Made It _Clearer_?

If you're bold enough, there’s a pragmatic approach that uses both forms _intentionally_:

- Use **plural** when the route returns an array:  
    `/api/users` → returns a list of users  
    `/api/users?gender=male` → still a list
    
- Use **singular** when the route returns a single object:  
    `/api/user/:userId` → returns one user object
    

This isn't about being rebellious. It's about **helping your fellow developers — including your future self — know what to expect just by glancing at the URL**.  
If the route says `/user/:id`, you can reasonably expect your code to handle a **single object**.  
If it says `/users`, you can prepare for an **array**.  
If there’s no match, it can return an **empty object** or an **empty array**, depending on the route.

That kind of clarity can prevent bugs, reduce guesswork, and make API consumption feel intuitive.

### 🧪 Example

```http
GET /api/users              → returns an array of users
GET /api/user/abc123        → returns a single user object
GET /api/users?role=admin   → returns a filtered array
```

### 💬 The Bottom Line: Choose Clarity, Then Communicate

The key is **clear communication**:

- Be consistent in your codebase
    
- Explain your convention in your API documentation
    
- Make sure your team agrees on the style
    

Whether you stick to plurals or adapt a singular/plural distinction for clarity, make your intent obvious — and stick to it.
