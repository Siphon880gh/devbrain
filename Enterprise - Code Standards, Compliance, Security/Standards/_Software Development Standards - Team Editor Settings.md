## 👨‍💻 Team Conventions through VS Code Settings

Enforce consistent formatting across the team:

- Use `.editorconfig` or `.vscode/settings.json`
- Standardize:
    - Indentation (e.g., 2 spaces)
    - Tabs vs. spaces
    - EOL characters
    - Trailing newlines

Helps reduce merge conflicts and improves code readability.
