### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Get Started with Ghost

#### ‚úÖ Option 1: Install via Ghost CLI

```bash
npm install -g ghost-cli
mkdir my-blog && cd my-blog
ghost install
```

> Requires a Linux server (Ubuntu recommended), Node.js, MySQL, and NGINX or Apache.

#### ‚úÖ Option 2: Run with Docker

```bash
docker run -d --name ghost \
  -p 2368:2368 \
  -v /path/to/ghost/content:/var/lib/ghost/content \
  ghost
```

### üåê Setting `siteUrl` in Ghost

In `config.production.json`:

```json
{
  "url": "https://yourdomain.com",
  ...
}
```

This `url` value tells Ghost where it lives‚Äîused in links, SEO metadata, RSS feeds, and more. Unlike some static site generators, Ghost handles routing dynamically, so you don't need to worry about a separate `baseUrl`.

### ü§ñ Automating SEO Content with AI

Because Ghost provides an Admin API, you can connect it with tools like:

- OpenAI / ChatGPT
    
- Zapier / n8n
    
- Custom Python or Node.js scripts
    

Example: Automatically generate SEO-optimized blog drafts with AI, then publish them via the Ghost Admin API. This makes it ideal for teams looking to scale up content publishing without sacrificing quality.
