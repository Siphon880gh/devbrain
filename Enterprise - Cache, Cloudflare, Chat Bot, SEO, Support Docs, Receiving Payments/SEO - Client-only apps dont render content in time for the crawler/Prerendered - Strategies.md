You have a few ways to capture SEO-friendly HTML from a client-rendered React (CRA/Vite) app:

1. **Headless-browser prerendering (e.g., Puppeteer)**

   * Spin up a headless browser at build time—or on demand.
   * Load the target page, perform any required clicks, wait for the desired DOM node or a fixed timeout, then save the resulting HTML.
   * Works well for pages that need user interaction before they’re ready.

2. **Lightweight snapshot tools (e.g., `prerender` library)**

   * Skip manual interactions; the library waits until rendering finishes, then dumps the whole HTML.
   * Automatically captures Helmet-generated meta tags for each route (or falls back to the defaults).

3. **Manual static generation fallback**

   * If the above methods still miss content because of the way your React code is structured, write a custom script that produces static HTML directly.
   * This breaks DRY—you maintain both JSX and parallel HTML-generation logic—but it guarantees completeness.

4. **When to run it**

   * **Build time:** Add a post-build script so your CI/CD pipeline produces all static files before deploy.
   * **On demand:** Let an Express middleware check for a prerendered file. If it doesn’t exist, generate it once, cache it (in other words, save it on file, or use Redis to key save), and serve the cached version on future requests. This would be a further implementation of [[Prerendered - Express server.js delivers prerendered file if exists]]

Choose the option that reliably outputs the HTML search crawlers need.
