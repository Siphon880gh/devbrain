React apps built with tools like **Vite** use client-side rendering by default, which means there's no server-side rendering (SSR). This can be a problem for SEO, because tools like **Ahrefs** and other static crawlers don't execute JavaScript. As a result, key content—such as meta tags, page text, and outbound links—might be missing in the initial HTML, leading to poor SEO scores or false errors.

On the other hand, some platforms **do** render JavaScript before scraping:
- **Googlebot** (used by Google Search)
- **Facebook Sharing Debugger**
- **Twitter Card Validator**
- **LinkedIn Post Inspector**
- **Screaming Frog SEO Spider** (with JavaScript rendering enabled)
- **Puppeteer** / **Playwright** (for custom scrapers)

> If you must stick with your current Vite-based frontend stack, there are a few ways to mitigate the SEO rendering issue:

**Option 1: Pre-render at Build Time**

- Use a script during the production build (`npm run build`) to generate static HTML versions of key pages.
    
- Tools like `vite-plugin-ssr`, `rendertron`, or headless browser automation (e.g., Puppeteer) can help.
    
- Caveat: This may add significant build time depending on the number of pages.
  
- This is unrealistic when you have a 100 pages and/or the pages will frequently update.
    

**Option 2: Background Pre-rendering with Express**

- Serve your app via an Express.js server.
    
- In a separate thread/process, generate and cache pre-rendered HTML files for popular routes.
    
- These static snapshots can then be served quickly to crawlers.
    

**Option 3: On-Demand Pre-rendering**

- When a user (or bot) requests a page:
    
    1. Check if a pre-rendered version exists.
        
    2. If not, or if it’s older than a week, generate a fresh snapshot.
        
    3. Save and serve the pre-rendered file.
       
    4. If an endpoint or script updates your database, remove the relevant pre-rendered file if exists. This will force a pre-render on the next visit.
               
- This hybrid method balances freshness and performance without bloating your build step.
    

> These solutions help search engines and social platforms access fully rendered content without requiring a full switch to SSR or static-site frameworks like **Next.js** or **Gatsby**.
