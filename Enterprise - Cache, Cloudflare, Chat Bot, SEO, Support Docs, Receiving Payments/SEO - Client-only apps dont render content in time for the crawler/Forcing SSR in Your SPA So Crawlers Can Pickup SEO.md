Here’s a breakdown of your main approaches to “force” server-rendering (or pre-rendering) your SPA, with pros, cons, and key configuration notes:

---

## 1. Prerender SPA Plugin / Prerenderer Middleware

Leverages a headless browser under the hood (usually Puppeteer) to crawl your routes at build- or run-time.

- **Automatic rendering modes**
    
    - `renderAfterTime: <ms>`: waits a fixed delay before snapshotting.
        
    - `renderAfterElementExists: <selector>`: waits until a DOM element appears.  
        – _Issue:_ if you set any of these, the plugin assumes “you want automation,” and will ignore your custom render function.
        
- **Custom render function**
    
    - You can supply your own Puppeteer script to do arbitrary navigation or DOM-manipulation before capturing the HTML.
        
    - _Tip:_ remove all `renderAfter*` options so the plugin invokes your function instead of its default logic.
        
- **When to use:**
    
    - You want fine-grained control over how and when each route is snapshotted.
        
    - You’re already using Webpack/Vite and want it baked into your build pipeline.

## 2. Hand-rolled Puppeteer Script

Write your own Node script that drives Headless Chrome outside of any plugin.

```js
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';

async function capture(urls) {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  
  // optional: log in or seed some state
  await page.goto('https://example.com/login');
  await page.type('#user', '…');
  await page.click('#submit');
  await page.waitForNavigation();
  
  for (const route of urls) {
    await page.goto(`https://example.com${route}`, { waitUntil: 'networkidle0' });
    const html = await page.content();
    // write html to disk
  }
  
  await browser.close();
}
```

- **Pros:** total flexibility (chain multiple navigations, wait for arbitrary conditions, inject cookies, etc.).
    
- **Cons:** you’ll need to handle parallelism, caching, error-retries, and integrate with your deployment or build.

## 3. Rendertron (Self-Hosted)

An open-source headless-Chrome rendering proxy originally by Google:

- **How it works:**
    
    1. You deploy Rendertron as a lightweight service.
        
    2. Your CDN or webserver (or your SPA’s server) proxies crawler requests to Rendertron.
        
    3. Rendertron returns fully rendered HTML.
        
- **Key config:**
    
    - Point your user-agent/sniffer middleware to `rendertron` for bots only (so real users still hit your client bundle).
        
    - Can cache renderings in memory or an external cache (Redis).
        
- **Pros:**
    
    - Offloads SSR from your main app servers.
        
    - Works out-of-the-box with minimal coding.
        
- **Cons:**
    
    - Extra infrastructure.
        
    - You still need to ensure your rendering service is fast enough under load.

## 4. Prerender.io (SaaS)

A commercial equivalent to Rendertron with additional features:

- **Flow:** you configure your site to point crawlers at Prerender.io. They cache and serve snapshots.
    
- **Pros:** zero-ops, automatic HTTPS, built-in cache invalidation hooks.
    
- **Cons:** paid beyond free tier; you’re relying on an external service.

## 5. Framework-Built SSR / SSG

If you’re open to migrating or adopting a meta-framework:

- **Next.js / Nuxt.js / SvelteKit / Astro, etc.**  
    – They support per-page SSR or Static-Site Generation (SSG) with incremental revalidation.
    
- **Pros:**
    
    - Deep integration (data-fetching hooks, code splitting, optimized payloads).
        
    - No headless-Chrome maintenance.
        
- **Cons:**
    
    - You’ll need to refactor your routing and data layers.
        
    - Larger framework dependency.

### Which to pick?

|Approach|Control|Ops Overhead|Infra Needed|Refactor Scope|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Prerender SPA Plugin|Medium–High|Low|None (build only)|Minimal|
|Custom Puppeteer Script|Very High|High|None (but you run it)|Minimal|
|Rendertron (self-hosted)|Low|Medium|Rendertron service|None|
|Prerender.io (SaaS)|Low|Low|External service|None|
|Full SSR Framework|High|Medium|Node servers|High|

1. **If you just need a few static snapshots** and want to stay in your existing build: stick with the prerender-plugin and fix your config (remove `renderAfterTime` / `renderAfterElementExists` so your custom render function actually runs).
    
2. **If you need one-off or very custom flows** (e.g. login, multi-page sequences): write your own Puppeteer script.
    
3. **If you want a crawler-only proxy** with zero code changes: use Rendertron or Prerender.io.
    
4. **If you’re willing to refactor for on-demand SSR** and richer data fetching: consider moving to a full SSR framework like Next.js.
