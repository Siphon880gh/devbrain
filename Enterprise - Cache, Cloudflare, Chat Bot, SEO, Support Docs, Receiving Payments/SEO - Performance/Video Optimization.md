When adding videos to a website, two challenges usually come up:

1. **File size is too large** ‚Üí slows down page load and hurts SEO scores.
2. **Video won‚Äôt play instantly** ‚Üí the browser waits until it has enough data before starting playback.

Here‚Äôs how to fix both.

## 1. Use CRF to Control Quality vs. File Size

When encoding video with **FFmpeg**, the most important setting is **CRF (Constant Rate Factor)**. It balances size and quality.

- **Lower CRF (e.g., 18‚Äì20)** ‚Üí higher quality, bigger files.
    
- **Higher CRF (e.g., 23‚Äì28)** ‚Üí smaller files, but more compression.
    

üëâ For the web, a **CRF of 20‚Äì23** is usually the sweet spot: small enough to load quickly, but still sharp enough for most screens.

## 2. Enable Fast Playback With `faststart`

MP4 files contain a **moov atom**, which holds the ‚Äútable of contents‚Äù for the video.

- If the moov atom is **at the end** (common with some encoders), the browser **must download the whole file before playing**.
    
- If the moov atom is **moved to the beginning**, playback can start right away while the rest downloads in the background.
    

FFmpeg makes this easy with the flag:

```bash
-movflags +faststart
```

This alone can dramatically improve how fast videos feel on your site.

## 3. Recommended FFmpeg Command for Web Videos

Here‚Äôs a one-liner you can use to generate a web-optimized MP4:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mov \
  -c:v libx264 -crf 20 -preset slow -pix_fmt yuv420p \
  -c:a aac -b:a 128k \
  -movflags +faststart \
  output_fastmov.mp4
```

**Explanation:**

- `-c:v libx264` ‚Üí Uses H.264, the most widely supported video codec.
- `-crf 20` ‚Üí High quality, smaller than lossless (use 23 for smaller files, 18 for max quality).
- `-preset slow` ‚Üí Better compression (can use `faster` if speed matters).
- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ‚Üí Ensures compatibility with all browsers/devices.
- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` ‚Üí Standard web audio settings.
- `-movflags +faststart` ‚Üí Moves the moov atom to the front.

## 4. Other Quick Wins

- **Use preload="metadata"** on `<video>` tags to avoid unnecessary loading.
- **Compress poster images** (and lazy-load them) to save bandwidth.
- **Consider WebM (VP9/AV1)** for additional savings, with MP4 as fallback for Safari.

## 5. Bottom Line

For web delivery, the two key things are:  
‚úÖ Use **CRF around 20‚Äì23** to keep size manageable.  
‚úÖ Always **add `-movflags +faststart`** so the video can play immediately.

This balance keeps your pages light, fast, and SEO-friendly‚Äîwhile ensuring visitors don‚Äôt wait around for your videos to load.
