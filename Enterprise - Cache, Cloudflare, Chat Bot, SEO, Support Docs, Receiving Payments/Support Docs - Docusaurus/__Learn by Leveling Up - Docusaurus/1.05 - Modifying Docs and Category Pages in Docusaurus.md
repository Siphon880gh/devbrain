## Auto generates from folders of MD files

Create folders and md files as needed in docs/ to expand your docs and users access your docs at the sidebar under Tutorial tab (of the header navbar)

^ In codebase at root folder's docs/ are two folders `tutorial-basics`  and `tutorial-extras`  alongside a MD file for `Tutorial Intro` . Therefore at the sidebar's root level, you can view a Tutorial Intro page but you can't expand it for more pages. You can expand Basics and Extras for more notes. Note that you can also click the text for Basics and Extras to see their generated Category Page (not MD file like Tutorial Intro's) - Explaining in a bit

## Category Page of a Folder

Each subfolder should have a `_category_.json`  for designing the folder name and how the category page from clicking the actual words look:  
```
{
	"label": "Tutorial - Basics",
	"position": 2,
	"link": {
	"type": "generated-index",
	"description": "5 minutes to learn the most important Docusaurus concepts."
}
```

For example the description controls the description on the category page of clicking the folder directly (instead of the expand or collapse "chevron" button):

Proof:

1 of 2- This is clicking "Tutorial Intro" which is NOT a Category page because it's associated with a .md file. Now contrast "1 of 2" screenshot to "2 of 2" screenshot.

2 of 2- This is clicking a folder name "Tutorial - Extras". The page it generates is automatically based on the `link.description` field in `_category_.json` and the documents that are in that folder (generates cards that link to them)

TLDR: A category page provides an introductory overview of the folder’s top-level content, along with a collection of article previews that link to the corresponding doc.
