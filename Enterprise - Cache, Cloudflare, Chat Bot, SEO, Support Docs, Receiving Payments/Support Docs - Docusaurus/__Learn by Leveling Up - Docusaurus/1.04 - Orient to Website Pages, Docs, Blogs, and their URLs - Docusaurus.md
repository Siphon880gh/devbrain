Then you may want to redesign the whole website. Note the two main folder paths:
- src/pages  
- src/components  

And orientating to how the files correlate to the url's:
```
src/pages/index.js → localhost:3000/  
src/pages/foo.md → localhost:3000/foo  
src/pages/foo/bar.js → localhost:3000/foo/bar
```

Now the Docs. The key path is:

- ./docs which correlates to localhost:3000/docs
- Eg. `docs/tutorial-basics/create-a-page.md`  file in the codebase correlates to [http://localhost:3000/docs/tutorial-basics/create-a-page](http://localhost:3000/docs/tutorial-basics/create-a-page)

Similar thing going on with ./blog → localhost:3000/blog
