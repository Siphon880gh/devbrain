At the docs/ md files, notice the frontmatter yaml syntax above each doc (md file):
```
---  
sidebar_position: 2  
---
```

The sidebar ordering rules for an Autogenerated sidebar is as follows:
- **Files with `sidebar_position`**
	- Shown **first**, sorted in ascending order (e.g., 1, 2, 3…).
	- Negative numbers work too, so it's really (eg. -N,..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3... N)
- **Files without `sidebar_position`**
	- Shown **after** all positioned files.
	- Ordered **alphabetically by filename**.
- To force a file to the bottom:
	- Leave out `sidebar_position` (if all other docs in the folder have a position), **or**
	- Use a **very high `sidebar_position`** like `999`. But will still appear above files that don't have a `sidebar_position` . Depending on your use case, you may want to write a cli node script that can take a folder and update or create sidebar_position for all items in alphabetical order. Then remove the sidebar_position from the note(s) you want to be at the bottom.

Inside Tutorial - Basics → deploy-your-site.md

Change 5 to -5 so it's:
```
---  
sidebar_position: -5  
---
```

"Deploy your site" is now moved to the very top:

At the "markdown-features.mdx" (btw mdx is an alternate syntax to md that can support jsx components), change the sidebar_position from 4 to 99 (a high number):
```
---  
sidebar_position: 99  
---
```

Now "Markdown" appears at the bottom (almost like a misc feature doc after Congratulations. This proves that the side_position values among the docs don't need to be consecutive, but the order is based on who has a less or greater position value:

At "congratulations.md", remove the frontmatter yaml:
![[Pasted image 20250522022446.png]]


That resets the "Congratulations" to the very bottom because it no longer has a position value. This demonstrates that non-positioned docs appear after positioned docs:

Now at the "markdown-features.mdx", remove the frontmatter yaml too:
![[Pasted image 20250522022527.png]]

There are now two docs that don't have position values, so they're at the bottom. Those non-positioned docs will be sorted alphabetically where they're at. **C**ongratulations will appear before **M**arkdown Features.
