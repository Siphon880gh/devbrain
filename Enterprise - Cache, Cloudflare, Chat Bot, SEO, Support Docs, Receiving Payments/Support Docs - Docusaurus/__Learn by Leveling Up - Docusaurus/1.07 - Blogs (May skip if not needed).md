Blogs follow different rules for frontmatter YAML to fill in the blog layout:
```
---  
slug: long-blog-post  
title: Long Blog Post  
authors: yangshun  
tags: [hello, docusaurus]  
---
```

Poke around to figure out:
- How there can be a tag on a blog and user clicks the tag to reveal all blogs that are associated with that tag (hint: tags.yml and frontmatter tags field)
- How the author photo etc are injected into the blog (hint: authors.yml and frontmatter authors field)
- You can change the url or slug in the front matter
- authors and tags can accept multiple values (as an array of strings) or single values (as string):
```
---  
slug: first-blog-post  
title: First Blog Post  
authors: [slorber, yangshun]  
tags: [hola, docusaurus]  
---
```
