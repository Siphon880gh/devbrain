## Auto generates from folders of MD files

Create folders and md files as needed in docs/ to expand your docs and users access your docs at the sidebar under Tutorial tab (of the header navbar)

^ In codebase at root folder's docs/ are two folders `tutorial-basics`  and `tutorial-extras`  alongside a MD file for `Tutorial Intro` . Therefore at the sidebar's root level, you can view a Tutorial Intro page but you can't expand it for more pages. You can expand Basics and Extras for more notes. Note that you can also click the text for Basics and Extras to see their GENERATED COVER PAGE (not MD file like Tutorial Intro's) - Explaining in a bit

## Cover Page of a Folder

Each subfolder should have a `_category_.json`  for designing the folder name and how the cover page from clicking the actual words look:  
```
{
	"label": "Tutorial - Basics",
	"position": 2,
	"link": {
	"type": "generated-index",
	"description": "5 minutes to learn the most important Docusaurus concepts."
}
```

For example the description controls the description on the cover page of clicking the folder directly (instead of the expand or collapse chevron button):

## Rearrange hierarchy and the sidebar auto-generates

Drag extras folder into basics folder:

This drastically changes the hierarchy level for extras:

And with hotreload, you see the sidebar instantly rearranges to have the "Tutorials - Extras" linked group nested in the "Tutorial - Basics" group rather than staying as sibling groups:
