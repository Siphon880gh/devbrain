As a developer, when working with different levels of caching, you might encounter situations where your cache appears to be stuck. In such cases, clearing your cache is often a necessary part of the debugging process.

To save time, it's helpful to have a folder of bookmarks for sites you frequently use, allowing you to quickly log back in once you're ready.

Here are some examples of sites you might want to include in your bookmarks folder:
- Email services like Gmail or Hotmail
- GitHub for version control
- Social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram
- Productivity tools like Notion
- E-commerce sites such as Amazon for personal purchases
- If your YouTube keeps switching to a default profile that you don't like after clearing cache, add Youtube to your bookmarks folder as well.

You can right click the folder and open all bookmarks at once, then go through each tab to re-login. If you have websites that requires a second device to login or an authenticator app, keep your phone handy whenever you're re-logging back in after cache clearing.
