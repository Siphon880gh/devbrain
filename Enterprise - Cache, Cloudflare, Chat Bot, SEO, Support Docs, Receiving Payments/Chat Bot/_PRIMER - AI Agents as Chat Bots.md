## Botpress' Autonomous Node

Botpress has this AI Agent feature that can take over the entire conversation flow in only one node - known as the Autonomous Node, only available on Botpress Cloud free and higher tiers.

In order to properly set the AI Agent, you would have to add an AI Agent prompt. For information on how to add such a prompt, refer to [[AI Agents - Prompt]]
