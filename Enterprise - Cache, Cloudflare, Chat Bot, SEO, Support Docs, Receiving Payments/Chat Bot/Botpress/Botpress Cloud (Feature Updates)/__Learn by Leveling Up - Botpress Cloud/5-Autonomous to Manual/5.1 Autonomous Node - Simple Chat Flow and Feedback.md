Let's make a simple workflow
Start -> AutonomousNode -> End

![[Pasted image 20250521010247.png]]

Configure the Autonomous Node:
Instructions/prompt should be 
```
Ask user to pick one or many choices:
Apple, Cat, Dog, Orange, Hat, Glasses

Then complete a sentence using the chosen word.
```

Chat flow would be:
1 of 2:

2 of 2:

This is awesome. Let's explore "Improve Response"

Click the "Improve Response" button. A modal appears where you can describe how you want the AI to act in the future:
- Notice the Code section is how the AI responded to you. You do not modify this section (You can't). It just lets you know how the AI thought and responded.

Entering the feedback: `Don't mention the chosen word. Don't mention you're giving a sentence. Just give the sentence.`

Then we hit Re-generate, it shows a git diff visual of the new code (again, the code represents how the AI thinks and responds):
![[Pasted image 20250521011232.png]]

^ Notice the red is the old way of how AI thinks and responds to your chosen word. And that the green text is the new way. The new way doesn't mention what word is chosen, nor does it mention a sentence is being given. That's perfect. So we can click: Save as Learning

After saving the learning, open a new chat session and try again. You should see the instructions take over. But Botpress Cloud's training is iffy. Now we have a problem:
![[Pasted image 20250521013036.png]]

Now we need to improve the first response
![[Pasted image 20250521013103.png]]

Try a new Chat session again:
![[Pasted image 20250521013132.png]]

Now it's as expected.

What have we learned from this? It's better to just modify the Instructions directly to prevent those iffy side effects that we had to re-train the AI on. The new Instructions/Prompt:
```
Ask user to pick one or many choices:
Apple, Cat, Dog, Orange, Hat, Glasses

Then complete a sentence using the chosen word. Don't mention the chosen word. Don't mention you're giving a sentence. Just give the sentence
```


You can reset the reinforcements by going to Tables -> Feedback:
- Select Tables -> Feedback:
  ![[Pasted image 20250521020946.png]]
- See the Feedback records:
	- Your feedback versus what the AI interpreted the behavior it should modify is at column "learning"
	  ![[Pasted image 20250521021119.png]]
- You can delete the rows to remove the learning (and free up from table rows quota):
