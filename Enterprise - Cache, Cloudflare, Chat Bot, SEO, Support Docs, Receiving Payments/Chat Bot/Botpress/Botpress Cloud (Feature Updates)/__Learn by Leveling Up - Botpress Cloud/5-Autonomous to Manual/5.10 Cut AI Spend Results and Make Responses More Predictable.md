To cut AI Spend costs from Autonomous Nodes, you should learn these steps:
1. **Prompting the AI Agent (Autonomous Node)**  
    Learners begin by crafting effective prompts to control the **Autonomous Node**, allowing the AI to take over the conversation flow using a well-structured “mega prompt.” This teaches how to guide AI responses strategically and prototype flows rapidly.
2. **Observing the AI-Led Chat Flow**  
    Next, learners use the **chat emulator** to interact with the AI-driven flow. They observe how the AI handles user intent, question sequencing, and branching logic to achieve conversation goals. The learner could screen record the different chat scenarios so they can replay the video fore reference later.
3. **Rebuilding the Flow Manually (Standard Nodes)**  
    With the AI-led flow as reference, learners then **disable the Autonomous Node** and attempt to **recreate the same flow manually** using **Standard Nodes**. This reinforces flow logic, intent detection, and conversation structuring without relying on AI.

**Why This Approach Works**  
This hybrid approach lets learners or teams **rapidly prototype** chat experiences using AI, even when they're unsure how to structure the flow at first. Later, they can **migrate to a manual flow** using Standard Nodes—ideal for production use cases where AI usage needs to be minimized to **reduce token/credit costs** or meet compliance and predictability requirements.
