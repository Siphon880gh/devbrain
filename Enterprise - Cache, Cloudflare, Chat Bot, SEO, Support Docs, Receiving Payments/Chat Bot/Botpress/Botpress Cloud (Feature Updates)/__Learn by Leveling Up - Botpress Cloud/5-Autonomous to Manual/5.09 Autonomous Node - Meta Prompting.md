Background: What is Meta-Prompting? It's asking AI to design the best prompt for you to use with AI to achieve your desired AI behavior.

In our case, Meta-Prompting is taking a prompt that has all the best practices and is structured well for Botpress Cloud to take over the chat conversation, feeding that into ChatGPT, then asking ChatGPT to adopt it for your business needs, instructing about your company name, explaining what your company does, giving the sequence of questions that should be asked, and instructing on what contact information you need from the user.

1. Get your sequence of question by going to ChatGPT and asking:
	- Adjust your company information
	```
	Help come with a sequence of questions for my company: "We are a transformative consultant company that will help your company automate processes and job roles so you can minimize the staffing needed"
	```

2. Save that sequence of questions for later
3. On a separate ChatGPT thread, ask it to incorporate your business needs and sequence of questions into the mega prompt:
   
```
I found this successful mega prompt used to guide an AI-powered chatbot's conversation flow. I'd like to adapt it for my own business.

What if you have multiple alternate chat flows?

For example, in this chat:

^ Each option would be a different series of questions

Your mega prompt could be from [[5.04 Autonomous Node - Alternate Sequences with Best Practices]]
