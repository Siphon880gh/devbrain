Let's make a simple workflow
Start -> AutonomousNode -> End

![[Pasted image 20250521010247.png]]

Configure the Autonomous Node:
Instructions/prompt should be 
```
Ask user to pick one or many choices:
Apple, Cat, Dog, Orange, Hat, Glasses

Then complete a sentence using the chosen word.
```

Chat flow would be:
1 of 2:

This is awesome. Let's explore "Improve Response"

Click the "Improve Response" button. A modal appears where you can describe how you want the AI to act in the future:
- Notice the Code section is how the AI responded to you. You do not modify this section (You can't). It just lets you know how the AI thought and responded.

Entering the feedback: `Don't mention the chosen word. Don't mention you're giving a sentence. Just give the sentence.`

Then we hit Re-generate, it shows a git diff visual of the new code (again, the code represents how the AI thinks and responds):

^ Notice the red is the old way of how AI thinks and responds to your chosen word. And that the green text is the new way. The new way doesn't mention what word is chosen, nor does it mention a sentence is being given. That's perfect. So we can click: Save as Learning

>[!note] Btw - Feedback Table

If you access Tables, you'll see records of feedback you provided to the Chat Bot:

Done.
