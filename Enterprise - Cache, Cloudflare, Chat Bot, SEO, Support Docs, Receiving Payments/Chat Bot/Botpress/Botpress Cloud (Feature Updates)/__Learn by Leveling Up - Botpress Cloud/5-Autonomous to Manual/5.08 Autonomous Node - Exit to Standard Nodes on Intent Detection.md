Use detected intents to exit AI control and route the user to a handoff or specific standard node when needed.

Note: I'm using the word "intent" in the general purposes of AI Bot detecting the user wants a specific action like buying or exiting the conversation. The feature called "Intents" and "Entities" at Botpress Cloud has been sunsetted on April 2025.


Let's setup some standard notes that exit out of the autonomous node. Note you could have linked a sequence of standard nodes for other use cases. Let's use the Google Search and Video Embed prompt for our Autonomous Bot from [[5.06 Autonomous Node - Addon Prompt - Video Embed or Youtube Link]].

Except.. we are going to make this Google Search Rep bot more sassy:

And also make it know when the user wants to end the conversation. More on that in a bit.

Let's think about this workflow:

Node in focus:

This is an Autonomous Node. But note it can still take cards! Add transition cards:
![[Pasted image 20250521033132.png]]

Configure top condition:
- The condition is `The user asks about Microsoft or Bing`
![[Pasted image 20250521033146.png]]

Configure bottom condition:
- The condition is `The user wants to end the conversation`
![[Pasted image 20250521033226.png]]


Setup the rest of the workflow, particularly, you're outleting each condition to a possible chat message (Text Card):

Test that this chat conversation brings up a sassy Google Search rep that ends the conversation because you mentioned Bing:

That's great. What about the other intent where the user wants to end the conversation. 

That's unpredictable because ChatGPT has high bias for saying Good Bye back when the user says good bye (even at chat.com). This leads to unpredictability:
- On one of the rounds, ChatGPT gave a farewall, then Botpress sends the hard coded "Thanks for the chat. Good bye."

- On another round, ChatGPT gave a farewell, but Botpress thinks this was a successful chat response from ChatGPT and skipped over the intention `The user wants to end the conversation`:

The solution is to "Improve Response" with the feedback: `End chat bot`:
- Don't forget to press Re-generate
- Notice the new Code has `workflow.transition` that matches the detected user intent with the programmed condition:  ![[Pasted image 20250521034255.png]]
