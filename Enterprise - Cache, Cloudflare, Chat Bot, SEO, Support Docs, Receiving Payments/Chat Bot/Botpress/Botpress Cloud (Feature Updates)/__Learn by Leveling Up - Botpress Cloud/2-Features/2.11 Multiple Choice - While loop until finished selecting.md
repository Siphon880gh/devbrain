Let's ask the user to select multiple things they value in their life:

Select things you want more in your life:

And it will loop back to answering the same question until the user is satisfied choosing all the things they want in their lives:

User choosing to finish selecting:

The Chat finishes after user chose to finish selecting:

You should have the knowledge to figure this out.

Hints:
- The workflow may look like:
  ![[Pasted image 20250519061429.png]]
  - Adjust the Multiple Choice based on the screenshot chat
	  - What's the question
	  - What are the choices
  - Capture the Multiple Choice to a variable `workflow.chosenAnswer`:
  - Standard3 node has two Expressions for:
	  - `{{workflow.chosenAnswer!="FINISHED SELECTING"}}` at "Still Selecting"
	  - `{{workflow.chosenAnswer=="FINISHED SELECTING"}}` at "Finished Selecting"
  - When Still Selecting, loop back to "Standard2" (the Multiple Choices). The variable `chosenAnswer` will be overridden by user selection and then re-evaluated against the two expressions to decide:
	  - Should we loop back again
	  - Or should we proceed
  - Or When Finished Selecting, proceeds to "Standard4" node which tells you to close your eyes and that your wish will come true.
