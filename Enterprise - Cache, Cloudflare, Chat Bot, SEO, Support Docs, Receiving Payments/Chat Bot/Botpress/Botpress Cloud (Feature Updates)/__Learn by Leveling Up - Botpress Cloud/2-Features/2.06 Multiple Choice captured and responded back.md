For this doc, we'd like the chat to echo back our answer, like this:

Hints:
- The Multiple Choice card has option to save to a variable. You can create a variable on the fly at this option. The variable then becomes available from that point on in the chat flow.

Editing the Multiple Choices card:

2 of 4:
- Let's create a variable that stores what the user selected. That variable can refer to the user's selection (would be A..., or B..., or C..., or D...) at a later node. That later node could output the variable to the user's chat

3 of 4:
- We'll name the variable `chosenAnswer`:

4 of 4:
- The variable is committed when it looks polished with the rest of the options

Adding the Text card that outputs the variable to the user's chat:
- Note variable is namedÂ `workflow.chosenAnswer`. We must prefix with `workflow.` when recalling the variable.
