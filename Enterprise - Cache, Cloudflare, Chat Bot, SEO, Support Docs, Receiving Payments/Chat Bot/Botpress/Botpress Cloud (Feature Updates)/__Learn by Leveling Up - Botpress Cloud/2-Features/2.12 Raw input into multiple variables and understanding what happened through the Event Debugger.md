Titled: Raw input into multiple variables and understanding what happened through the Event Debugger

Scenario: User wants to reach out to the webmaster in chat. Webmaster is not available. Ask user to give their name and email in a message. If they provided their name only, ask for their email on a second message. Had they provided only their email, ask for their name. These values are captured into variables. Then respond back with those variables in a confirmation message that you'll get back to them in a few business days.

---

## Goals x3:

Goal 1: User can provide both name and email in one message:

Goal 2: If user forgets to provide email, they will be asked to provide the email in the next message.

Goal 3: If user forgets to provide name, they will be asked to provide the name in the next message.

## Overview Steps
1. Use the **Raw Input** card. Enter message user will see that asks them for their name and email. No need to store variables because the user's response will pipe directly to the primitive Raw type cards.
2. Subsequently on the same node, add **Raw Email** and **Raw Person Name** cards. These primitive raw types will extract from previous message and store into variable `workspace.Email` and `workspace.Name`, respectively

---
## Steps

Workflow:
- One node (Standard2) for asking user for the data and processing the user's data into variables
- Subsequent node (Standard3) reports back their name and email address while informing that they will be reached in 1-2 business days.

Configure Raw Input
- Message to user: `Can I have your name and email?`
- Do not store variables. This Raw Input will act as a piper, piping over the user's inputs to the next cards - Raw Email and Raw Person Name - and its those primitive Raw Types that will store to `workflow.Email` and `workflow.Name`, respectively
![[Pasted image 20250519222604.png]]


Configure Raw Email
- User's previous message was piped into here. It extracts email from raw text and store into `workflow.Email`. As it detected piped in, Botpress won't display the message to user `Email?` because there's no point.
- If piping into this card has failed,  Botpress will display the message to user `Email?` because we need user to enter their email. Then the Raw card normally would act as a Raw Input that saves to the variable set at "Store result in". But before it stores to the variable, you don't want to store decorative words surrounding the name, like "My email is john@gmail.com" - you just want "john@gmail.com". Botpress' small Duckling AI server ([[Duckling - What Is]]) will kick in to parse because we added an "Extract from History" of 1 previous message. That option for "Extract from History" is not accessibly by default - you have to click Advanced Configuration at the bottom of the card options.

Configure Raw Person Name
- User's previous message was piped into here. It extracts name from raw text and store into `workflow.Name`. As it detected piped in, Botpress won't display the message to user `Name?` because there's no point.
- If piping into this card has failed,  Botpress will display the message to user `Name?` because we need user to enter their name. Then the Raw card normally would act as a Raw Input that saves to the variable set at "Store result in". But before it stores to the variable, you don't want to store decorative words surrounding the name, like "My name is John" - you just want "John". Botpress' small Duckling AI server ([[Duckling - What Is]]) will kick in to parse because we added an "Extract from History" of 1 previous message. That option for "Extract from History" is not accessibly by default - you have to click Advanced Configuration at the bottom of the card options.

Configure Text Card in the subsequent node:
- The message can be: `Weng will reach you on {{workflow.Email }} in 1-2 business days. Thanks {{workflow.Name.first}}.`
- Recall the workflow:

You are done. Next section will discuss how to interpret what just happened in an Event Debugger.

## **Event Debugger**

At the bottom of the Workflow, we should open Event Debugger. Then we open a fresh Chat Emulator session. We will look at Event Debugger as we chat with the emulator.

After replying to the Chat Bot both name and email:
1 of 2:
![[Pasted image 20250520022209.png]]

2 of 2:
Notice extraction is skipped. In fact, we've not enabled extraction at the Raw Input card.
![[Pasted image 20250520022218.png]]


Then the chat responds:

1 of 4:
- Notice in green that Email and Name variables are captured
![[Pasted image 20250519210257.png]]


2 of 4:
- The piped information is received at Raw Email. Although the Event Debugger didn't explicitly used the word "piped in", see that it logged an input `Input: My name is John Cena. Email is john@gmail.com` even though that was inputted at a prior card "Raw Input". This proves the input was piped into our Raw Email.
- The extracted value is transformed and saved into the variable "Email" as configured in the Raw Email card.
![[Pasted image 20250520022905.png]]

3 of 4:
The same process repeats for the Event Debugger item "Capture Information: Name". 
- The piped information is received at Raw Name. Although the Event Debugger didn't explicitly used the word "piped in", see that it logged an input `Input: My name is John Cena. Email is john@gmail.com` even though that was inputted at a prior card "Raw Input". This proves the input was piped into our Raw Name.
- The extracted value is transformed and saved into the variable "Name" as configured in the Raw Name card.
![[Pasted image 20250520022425.png]]

4 of 4:
Then the subsequent prompt has the Text Card referring to the stored variables while informing the user they will be reached in 1-2 business days. It runs to create the final message, then sends the message to the user's chat. Event Debugger:

## More practical workflow

Instead of the first message `Can I have your name and email?`, you can have it as `Hi, Weng is not available at the desk right now. Please provide your name and email and he will email you back.` It makes more sense on your website. Then after the user provides the email and name, we can use the same finishing message `Weng will reach you on {{workflow.Email }} in 1-2 business days. Thanks {{workflow.Name.first}}.` 

Looks more purposeful with the new wording:

## Caveats

- The official Botpress video on capturing multiple values using Raw Input and primitive Raw type cards leaves out a key step: assigning the extracted values to variables. Without this, the values are detected but not stored anywhereâ€”making their video instructions unusable in practice.:
  Raw input:
  [https://youtu.be/EK30zRYwlkg](https://youtu.be/EK30zRYwlkg)
- There is a glitch in Botpress Cloud as of 5/2025 where the order of the primitive Raw types matter:

	- GOOD:
	  ![[Pasted image 20250520033309.png]]
	- BAD:
	  ![[Pasted image 20250520033327.png]]

	  
		- The glitch:
		  Piping in fails completely for Raw Name and Raw Email, IF you forgot to mention your name on the Raw Input message that asks for both name and email, and IF you have Name as the first primitive raw type card under Raw Input card. This causes the two primitive Raw types to both ask for `Email?` and `Name?`:
		  ![[Pasted image 20250520033712.png]]
		  
		  So when capturing name and email, make sure email is the first primitive Raw Input below Raw Input.
		  
		  This should not be happening. I suspect Botpress Cloud will fix this in the future.
