Required: Work done from [[2.06 Multiple Choice captured and responded back]]

We continue the work.

Change the question and answers to:
- What's your most favorite color among these choices?
	- red
	- green
	- blue
	- yellow
	- orange

The previous doc just has the Chat Bot echoed back the user response:

Goal: For this doc, we'll have AI respond back with your choice, perhaps elaborating on your choice. Here user chose green, so the AI talks about a physical object that is primarily green.

Make the workflow look like:
![[Pasted image 20250519012624.png]]

The key node is here:
![[Pasted image 20250519012643.png]]

You'd have added an "AI Generate Text" to Standard Node.
- Note the UI quirk - you have to search the type "AI". Searching "Text" won't find it (It'll find Text Card, but not find AI Generate Text Card). Searching for "Generate" also finds "AI Generate Text"

Let's fill in the options for the AI Generate Text. Note that its final outlet is not producing text into the Chat. It can only outlet out into a variable. Here we did two major things:
- We create the prompt and included the chosenAnswer variable that captured the multiple choice selected from the user: `Give me a physical object that is primarily the color {{workflow.chosenAnswer}}` 
- Here we save it to a variable called `aiResponse` . Recall that you can create variables on the fly at the cards.

In the same node, we will now add a Text Card to produce the text to the user's chat (alternately, you could've connected to a new node who gets the Text Card)

^ Btw the screenshot shows a hint titled "Send Message". Any of those cards (Text card, Audio card, etc) are types of "Send Message". They must have overlooked updating the hint title.

For the text, we simply output `{{workflow.aiResponse}}`

Our key node now looks like:
![[Pasted image 20250519013222.png]]

The flow looks like this:
![[Pasted image 20250519013247.png]]


And at last, the Chat works as expected, having AI respond back to your choice by elaborating on it:
