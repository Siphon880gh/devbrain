Required: Previous doc(s). We will resume from previous work done.

Recall that in the previous lesson, we asked the user their favorite color. If they picked a color in the Multiple Choices, then it ends the chat by reporting back their favorite color that they clicked/selected.

However, if they picked "Others", it asks them to freetype their favorite color. Then it ends the chat by reporting back their favorite color that they typed in.

Recall that the ending nodes are:

Zoomed out, the entire workflow looks like:
![[Pasted image 20250519041448.png]]

In this tutorial we will "refactor" the workflow to look neater. It'll be broken down into three workflows:
- Main (the one we've been working on)
- Color chosen
- Others chosen

By refactoring, you will:
- How to create new workflow
- How to connect workflows
- How to change the scope of variables (because you can't pass variables between workflows as of 5/2025, we can make the variable have a more global scope than workflow scope)

At the Workflows Side Panel, right click empty area to create a New Workflow. We will create:
- ColorChosen
- OtherChosen
  Hint:
  ![[Pasted image 20250519052536.png]]


We want to move these nodes into the appropriate workflows:
- Copy and paste the node to the appropriate workflows. You can literally select the node â†’ CMD+C (If Mac). Delete the node from Main. Then at the other workflow, CMD+V (If Mac). Note that cutting doesn't work in Botpress.

Workflow "ColorChosen" should look like:
![[Pasted image 20250519052838.png]]

Workflow "OtherChosen" should look like:
![[Pasted image 20250519052903.png]]

At the main workflow, we enter the appropriate workflows where the removed nodes were:

How did I create those Workflow redirects? Right click empty area on the main workflow:

You'd think this will work. However, we now have a **scoping problem**.

Recall that the multiple choices are saved as `workflow.chosenAnswer`. We have to change the variable to be in the scope of conversation: `conversation.chosenAnswer`, so that the ColorChosen workflow has access to `chosenAnswer`.

Open the Variables panel (is below the Workflows panel). Look for your variable, `chosenAnswer` and change the scope
- Change Scope to `Conversation`
![[Pasted image 20250519054030.png]]


But notice the workflow "ColorChosen" still has workflow.chosenAnswer:
![[Pasted image 20250519052838.png]]

- Change ColorChosen's report back to `conversation.chosenAnswer`. Notice it goes from red to green:
  ![[Pasted image 20250519054342.png]]
- And results in this ColorChosen workflow:
  ![[Pasted image 20250519054403.png]]

Lastly, make sure to update the Expression's `chosenAnswer` scope. Otherwise, the first branch will always run resulting in (when user picks Other):
- WRONG
  ![[Pasted image 20250519054606.png]]


- WRONG top expression (A choice was selected)
  Will always evaluate true because undefined is indeed not equals to "Other"
![[Pasted image 20250519043713.png]]

- WRONG bottom expression (Other choice was selected)
  Will never be reached. But once you fix the top expression, this expression needs to be fixed too.
  ![[Pasted image 20250519043854.png]]

- Final change needed:
  Change `workflow...` to `conversation...` for both Expressions:
  ![[Pasted image 20250519055021.png]]

---

Now the conversation should flow as expected. If not, then you did something wrong, likely related to the variable scope fixes.

Expectations:
- Expect selecting the buttons other than "Other" works as usual, reporting back your chosen color:
  ![[Pasted image 20250519043313.png]]
- Expect selecting "Other" will ask you to type you favorite color. Then it resumes as normally, reporting back your chosen color.
