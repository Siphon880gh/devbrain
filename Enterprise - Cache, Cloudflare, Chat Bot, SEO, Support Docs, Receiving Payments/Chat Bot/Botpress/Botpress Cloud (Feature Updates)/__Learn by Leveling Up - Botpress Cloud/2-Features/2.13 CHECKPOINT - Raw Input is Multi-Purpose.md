Raw Input serves multiple purposes under the category of just taking raw input:

So far you've used Raw Input for "Other" so you saw it can capture into a variable directly

Previous lesson you just used Raw Input to 

just **pipe** user's message to the more primal raw types: Raw Person and Raw Email. This skips having to display Raw person's message or raw email's message unless user did not provide all the fields in Raw Input's message to user. So Raw Input serves as a **piper as well skipper** to the more primal raw types in the same node.
