Raw Input serves multiple purposes under the category of just taking raw input:

So far you've used Raw Input for "Other" so you saw it can capture into a variable directly

Previous lesson you just used Raw Input to just **pipe** user's message to the more primal raw types: Raw Person and Raw Email. This skips having to display Raw person's message or raw email's message unless user did not provide all the fields in Raw Input's message to user. So Raw Input serves as a **piper as well skipper** to the more primal raw types in the same node.

Raw Input has another purpose. Notice when configuring Raw Input, there's an optional Knowledge Base option:

Knowledge base can be the documents you uploaded or websites you scanned at the Knowledge Base tab in Botpress Cloud. However, knowledge base can also be temporary files that the user uploads inside the chat bot.

Next lesson ([[3.1 Knowledge Base - From User's File Upload]]) asks user to upload a recipe text file. Then user can ask questions about the recipe when the workflow reaches the Raw Input card. Refer to the step "Configure Raw Input Card"
