You want the user to be able to select any of the colors or select "Other". If they selected "Other", let them freetype what their favorite color is.


You'll learn:
- Dropdown vs selections
- Expression which if evaluated true will continue the workflow
- Raw input to capture free type into variable

Required: Previous doc(s). We will resume from previous work done.

First and foremost, your previous docs have the multiple choice selections as this:
![[Pasted image 20250519042917.png]]

We want to give the user an option to type their own color after selecting a button "Other":
- Configuring the Multiple Choices card, we add "Other":
  ![[Pasted image 20250519043012.png]]


Now if you test the Chat Emulator, the selection buttons are replaced with a dropdown. This is because when there are too many choices, Botpress will change them into a dropdown.
![[Pasted image 20250519041607.png]]


Goals:
- Goal 1. Selecting the buttons other than "Other" works as usual, reporting back your chosen color:
  ![[Pasted image 20250519043313.png]]
- Goal 2. Selecting "Other" will ask you to type you favorite color. Then it resumes as normally, reporting back your chosen color.

We will setup the nodes to look like this:
![[Pasted image 20250519041448.png]]

The node that outlets from the Multiple Choice Card should have two Expressions. Search for "Condition" (Actually searching for "Expression" or "Flow Logic" also works):
![[Pasted image 20250519043444.png]]

We will now focus on this node which consists of two possible Expressions. Depending on which Expression evaluates true first from top to bottom, the workflow resumes from that Expression:
![[Pasted image 20250519043546.png]]

First expression is if the user picked a color choice, then we resume the top branch:
- As best practice, the most likely expression should be first, to save your execution milliseconds. Most people will probably have their favorite color listed already
- When the chosen answer is not valued "Other"  (`{{workflow.chosenAnswer!="Other"}}`) - In other words, it's "red", "green", "blue", etc, then proceed.
- As of 5/2025, the current UI for adjusting Expression card is tricky. By default, it has the Label and the Condition AI generated - we want to turn off AI so we can configure directly. Refer to [[Annoying UI Quirk - Expression Card wants to be AI generated]]
- The expression configuration looks like:
  ![[Pasted image 20250519043713.png]]

Second expression is if the user picked "Other", then we resume the bottom branch:
- As best practice, the least likely expression should go final, to save your execution milliseconds on most runs. Most people will probably have their favorite color listed already
- When the chosen answer is valued "Other" (`{{workflow.chosenAnswer=="Other"}}`), then proceed.
- The expression configuration looks like:
  ![[Pasted image 20250519043854.png]]


Then the resulting branches from the two possible expressions are:
![[Pasted image 20250519043922.png]]

Notice when a color choice is chosen, the top branch runs, reporting back to the user the color they've chosen.

But when "Other" was selected, the bottom branch runs. This is the node named "Standard5". let's get into detail:
![[Pasted image 20250519044032.png]]

There are two cards in this node. The first card is a Raw Input which is found by searching for "Capture":
- Raw Input Card found:
  ![[Pasted image 20250519044132.png]]
  - The Raw Input Card is configured to ask the user to freetype their color, and then it stores the value under a variable called `customAnswer`:
    ![[Pasted image 20250519044217.png]]
- Then the next card (could be on a new node or the same node, but in this case, we have it under the same node) - is the Text Card. The text is just reporting back to the user the value stored in `customAnswer`:
  ![[Pasted image 20250519044032.png]]

So the resulting workflow is:
![[Pasted image 20250519041448.png]]

And the chat for "Other" is as expected:

And the chat for selecting a color is as expected:
