We've recently had AI add an enhancement in our code. AI wrote code to change the title value from the API response into title cased at [[4.1 GET from API End Point and Present to Chat]]

This document will cover some of AI's other abilities. Basically anything you can prompt with code can be done. You can transform current code (such as adding the title casing enhancement). And you can generate code from scratch using just a prompt.

CAVEAT: Although Botpress Cloud uses ChatGPT under the hood for requests like these, don't ask ChatGPT directly to write Botpress Cloud code. It's vastly outdated as of 5/2025. Botpress Cloud must have used a fine tune version of ChatGPT via its fine tuning API.

Some things that AI can do at Write Execute Code

	- Becomes more correct code that removed axios (no need to require axios inside Execute Code) and actually use desiredPayload
		```
		const desiredPayload = event.preview  
		  
		// POST JSON Payload and capture response for chat  
		const response = await axios.post(`http://echo.free.beeceptor.com/sample-request?author=beeceptor`, {  
		  name: 'John Doe',  
		  age: 30,  
		  city: 'New York',  
		  // Include the desired payload from the event preview  
		  additionalInfo: desiredPayload  
		})  
		workflow.serverResponse = response
		```
