We have an API endpoint that will return some words. We want those words to display in Chat when someone greets it.

Using a free test api service. Make sure their service is still online and that the API endpoint still works:
[https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1)

Visiting the URL directly in a web browser should've shown:
```
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "delectus aut autem",
  "completed": false
}
```

Recall that visiting an API end point in the web browser is equivalent to a GET request in the code. It'll get the same contents that was displayed in the web browser.

When you incorporate the code running behind the scene in the Chatbot, after the user greets hi, it'll return the API endpoint's data, especially `title`:

Below are hints how to implement

Desired workflow:

Cards:Â 
- Execute Card
- Text Card

How to find Execute Card - search for "execute":
![[Pasted image 20250519211143.png]]


Configure Execute Card:
```
const userId = event.userId  
const conversationId = event.conversationId  
const message = event.preview  
  
// Log the message being sent to the chat  
console.log(`Sending message: ${message}`)  
  
// Get title value from the API  
const response = await axios.get(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1`)  
const title = response.data.title // Extract the title from the response  
  
// Assign the extracted title to the workflow variable  
workflow.title = title
```

Configure Text Card:
```
The json response was {{workflow.title}}.
```


Going back to the workflow, let's discuss how this ties together:
- you can capture variables from a fetch request.
- and usually the text card outputs that variable's value

More - Learn how to use AI to help you write code:
- We should make the title value actually title cased
- We could certainly code this ourselves. But this is a good point to test if AI can do it. Let's ask AI to implement this enhancement by prompting: `Make the title value into title cased text`.

- There will be a git diff type interface where you can accept the proposed changes:

- Refresh the chat and you'll see the data title will be in title cased:
