We have an API endpoint that will return a response from a JSON payload. We want the results to display in the user's chat.

Using a free test api service. Make sure their service is still online. Visit their GET API Endpoint on the web browser:
http://echo.free.beeceptor.com

We expect JSON like:
```
{
  "method": "GET",
  "protocol": "http",
  "host": "echo.free.beeceptor.com",
  "path": "/",
  "ip": "47.41.205.31:52805",
  "headers": {
    "Host": "echo.free.beeceptor.com",
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/136.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
    "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7",
    "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate",
    "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.9",
    "Cookie": "_ga=GA1.1.617921493.1747739832; crisp-client%2Fsession%2F99053a41-4bc0-4de7-854c-a32802395bed=session_1b99d7ad-1734-4b4c-8499-9dba0fc2d688; _ga_C2WJBFR7TJ=GS2.1.s1747739832$o1$g1$t1747739839$j0$l0$h0",
    "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests": "1"
  },
  "parsedQueryParams": {},
  "parsedCookies": {
    "_ga": "GA1.1.617921493.1747739832",
    "crisp-client%2Fsession%2F99053a41-4bc0-4de7-854c-a32802395bed": "session_1b99d7ad-1734-4b4c-8499-9dba0fc2d688",
    "_ga_C2WJBFR7TJ": "GS2.1.s1747739832$o1$g1$t1747739839$j0$l0$h0"
  }
}
```

Once that passes, we can perform a more involved test by posting JSON payload to a POST API Endpoint.

We can test in terminal with a cURL command to POST with JSON payload:
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John Doe", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}' "http://echo.free.beeceptor.com/sample-request?author=beeceptor"
```

We expect the response:
```
{
  "method": "POST",
  "protocol": "http",
  "host": "echo.free.beeceptor.com",
  "path": "/sample-request?author=beeceptor",
  "ip": "47.41.205.31:52790",
  "headers": {
    "Host": "echo.free.beeceptor.com",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.87.0",
    "Content-Length": "51",
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept-Encoding": "gzip"
  },
  "parsedQueryParams": {
    "author": "beeceptor"
  },
  "parsedBody": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
  }
}
```

Now what we want to do is to give the chat user Multiple Choice options on what JSON payload to POST. Then we return the response to the user in the chat. We'll frame the chat bot as a "API Development Tutor" that teaches how post requests with payload may respond back from API testing services.

This is our desired workflow:
![[Pasted image 20250520045637.png]]

Nodes:
- Standard_4_2_1: Multiple Choices Card asks user to choose between two payloads
- Standard_4_2_2: Execute Code card takes the user's choice (`event.preview`), parses that choice from a JSON string, and sends a POST request with the user's chosen payload.
- Standard_4_2_3: Text Card displays the server's response which will include our payload (The server is an API Test service).

Configure Multiple Choices Card
- Message to user is:
	```
	Hi there! I'm your API Development Tutor.
	Let's start by choosing a JSON payload. Once selected, we’ll send it in a POST request to the Beeceptor API testing service.
	
	When the response comes back, I’ll show you the server's reply — including the method, status code, headers, and parsed response body.
	Take a moment to analyze what the server echoes back and how it matches the data we sent.
	```
  - Option 1 is: `{ "name": "John Doe", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}`
  - Option 2 is: `{ "name": "Jane Doe", "age": 20, "city": "Los Angeles"}`
  - Looks ilke:

Configure Execute Code Card:
- We are taking the user's choice (`event.preview` because that's whatever the user last typed or selected), then parsing its JSON string, and then sending a JSON Payload to Beereceptor. Awaiting the response, the response gets saved as a variable `workflow.serverResponse` for later displaying to the user.
- Code is:
	```
	const desiredPayload = event.preview
	const desiredPayloadObject = JSON.parse(desiredPayload) // Convert JSON string to object
	
	// POST JSON Payload and capture response for chat
	const response = await axios.post(
	`http://echo.free.beeceptor.com/sample-request?author=beeceptor`,
	desiredPayloadObject
	)
	workflow.serverResponse = response
	```
- Looks like:
  ![[Pasted image 20250520050201.png]]

Configure Text Card:
- Send server response that was saved as `workflow.serverResponse` to the user's chat:
- The message is:
	```
	Server responded with:\n{{workflow.serverResponse }}
	```
- Looks like:

Recall that this is our desired workflow:
