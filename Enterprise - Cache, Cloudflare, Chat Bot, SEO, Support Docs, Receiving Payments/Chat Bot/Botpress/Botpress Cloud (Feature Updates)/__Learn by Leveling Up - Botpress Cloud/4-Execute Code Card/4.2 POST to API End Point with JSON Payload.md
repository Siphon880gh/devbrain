We have an API endpoint that will return a response from a JSON payload. We want the results to display in the user's chat.

Using a free test api service. Make sure their service is still online. Visit their GET API Endpoint on the web browser:
http://echo.free.beeceptor.com

We expect JSON like:
```
{
  "method": "GET",
  "protocol": "http",
  "host": "echo.free.beeceptor.com",
  "path": "/",
  "ip": "47.41.205.31:52805",
  "headers": {
    "Host": "echo.free.beeceptor.com",
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/136.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
    "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7",
    "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate",
    "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.9",
    "Cookie": "_ga=GA1.1.617921493.1747739832; crisp-client%2Fsession%2F99053a41-4bc0-4de7-854c-a32802395bed=session_1b99d7ad-1734-4b4c-8499-9dba0fc2d688; _ga_C2WJBFR7TJ=GS2.1.s1747739832$o1$g1$t1747739839$j0$l0$h0",
    "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests": "1"
  },
  "parsedQueryParams": {},
  "parsedCookies": {
    "_ga": "GA1.1.617921493.1747739832",
    "crisp-client%2Fsession%2F99053a41-4bc0-4de7-854c-a32802395bed": "session_1b99d7ad-1734-4b4c-8499-9dba0fc2d688",
    "_ga_C2WJBFR7TJ": "GS2.1.s1747739832$o1$g1$t1747739839$j0$l0$h0"
  }
}
```

Once that passes, we can perform a more involved test by posting JSON payload to a POST API Endpoint.

We can test in terminal with a cURL command to POST with JSON payload:
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "John Doe", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}' "http://echo.free.beeceptor.com/sample-request?author=beeceptor"
```

We expect the response:
```
{
  "method": "POST",
  "protocol": "http",
  "host": "echo.free.beeceptor.com",
  "path": "/sample-request?author=beeceptor",
  "ip": "47.41.205.31:52790",
  "headers": {
    "Host": "echo.free.beeceptor.com",
    "User-Agent": "curl/7.87.0",
    "Content-Length": "51",
    "Accept": "*/*",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept-Encoding": "gzip"
  },
  "parsedQueryParams": {
    "author": "beeceptor"
  },
  "parsedBody": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
  }
}
```

Now what we want to do is to give the chat user Multiple Choice options on what JSON payload to POST. Then we return the response to the user in the chat. We'll frame the chat bot as a "API Development Tutor" that teaches how post requests with payload may respond back from API testing services.
