**How These Notes Teach Manual Chat Flow Design in Botpress**

These notes guide learners through mastering both AI-assisted and manual chat flow creation in Botpress.
1. **Prompting the AI Agent (Autonomous Node)**  
    Learners begin by crafting effective prompts to control the **Autonomous Node**, allowing the AI to take over the conversation flow using a well-structured “mega prompt.” This teaches how to guide AI responses strategically and prototype flows rapidly.
2. **Observing the AI-Led Chat Flow**  
    Next, learners use the **chat emulator** to interact with the AI-driven flow. They observe how the AI handles user intent, question sequencing, and branching logic to achieve conversation goals.
3. **Rebuilding the Flow Manually (Standard Nodes)**  
    With the AI-led flow as reference, learners then **disable the Autonomous Node** and attempt to **recreate the same flow manually** using **Standard Nodes**. This reinforces flow logic, intent detection, and conversation structuring without relying on AI.

**Why This Approach Works**  
This hybrid approach lets learners or teams **rapidly prototype** chat experiences using AI, even when they're unsure how to structure the flow at first. Later, they can **migrate to a manual flow** using Standard Nodes—ideal for production use cases where AI usage needs to be minimized to **reduce token/credit costs** or meet compliance and predictability requirements.
