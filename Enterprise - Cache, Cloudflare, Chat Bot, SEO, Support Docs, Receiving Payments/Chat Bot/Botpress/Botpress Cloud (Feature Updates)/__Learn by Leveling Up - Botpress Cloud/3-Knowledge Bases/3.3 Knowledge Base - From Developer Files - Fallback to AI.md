Continuing from the previous lesson [[3.2 Knowledge Base - From Developer Files]]...

We will fall back to ChatGPT's wide knowledge base when our own knowledge base can't answer the user's question.

---

Previously ,there was no ChatGPT's knowledge base fall back:

The chat looks like this:

Or the chat could look like this:

What we want is ChatGPT's wide knowledge base to take over if needed:

The trick is to have when the Knowledge Agent's answer is falsy (Empty/null), then send that question into an AI Generate Text. The AI Generate Text will ask the question to ChatGPT directly, then it will store the answer in variable `recipeAIResponse`, then we can display that variable in the user's chat:

The workflow is:
![[Pasted image 20250521001019.png]]

Configure AI Generate Text:
- Pass the question variable that originally was sent to the Knowledge Agent. We'll try the question with the AI node that has access to ChatGPT's wide knowledge base. Pass in variable `{{workflow.knowledgeAgentQuestion}}`
- Then after the AI node answers the question, store the answer in the variable `recipeAIResponse`.

> [!note] FYI: The pattern you may notice is that the AI Node never interacts with the Chat bot. Botpress designed some nodes with an eye towards separation of concerns - the AI Node is only concerned about the question and the answer, and does not know about the Chat.

- Looks like:

Configure Text Card:
- Send the AI response stored in variable `recipeAIResponse` to the user's chat using a Text Card. Does not need to be on a separate node, as long as its the card that follows after AI Generate Text Card:

Now test the chat bot - it should have knowledge (not from our knowledge base, but from ChatGPT's knowledge base):

Minimizing costs of AI Spend

Let's just say you notice an increase in customers asking about the Fettuccine recipe that isn't in your Knowledge Base.

It will save you AI Spend costs... if you added that recipe into your knowledge base. (Although free tier is very generous giving you $5 credit every month, as of 5/2025).

As a quick refresher, you can add recipe documents here:

As of 5/2025, Botpress Cloud is very generous with the AI Spend Credits. On Free accounts, it's $5 self-replenishing every month.
