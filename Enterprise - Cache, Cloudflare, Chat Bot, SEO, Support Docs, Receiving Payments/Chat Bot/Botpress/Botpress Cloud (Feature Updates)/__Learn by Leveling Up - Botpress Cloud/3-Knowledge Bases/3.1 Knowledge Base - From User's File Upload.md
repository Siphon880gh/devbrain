Learning Objectives
- How to read user file uploads (like text file)
- How to handle user file uploads (can be generalized to other use cases besides using user's text file as a knowledge base)

If you take a look at the Chat interface (Emulator or embedded), at the bottom left is a plus "+" button to upload files:
![[Pasted image 20250520054205.png]]

Let's create a Recipe AI Chat that lets users upload a recipe, then ask the AI any questions about that recipe.

The file the user uploads becomes a temporary Knowledge Base that the AI will refer to for future questions. The user will be prompted to ask questions, then we pass those questions to AI to answer about the recipe file.

In addition, we need to have the AI validate that the file is actually a recipe. It should end the conversation saying that it doesn't recognize a recipe.

Desired workflow and chat:

Zoomed-in:

And when user uploads something that is NOT a recipe:

Let's look at our desired workflow:

![[Pasted image 20250520054806.png]]

Nodes:
- Standard4: Capture File. It will upload to a cloud server and provide you with a URL saved into the variable `recipeFileUrl` 
- Standard5: Use Axios to read the file content text of the cloud URL and save as a variable `recipeFileContent` . As soon as the text is finished saving into `recipeFileContent`  from the axios request, use the Raw Input Card to inform user that it's ready to receive their question  - and store the user's question into a variable `recipeQuestion` .
- Standard6: AI Generate Text Card takes a prompt that contains the recipe text and the user question, and per the prompt, will only answer the question if the file is a recipe, but otherwise tells the user that this is not a recipe file. The AI response saves into variable `recipeAIResponse` . Then send message to user chat using Text Card that is simply `{{workflow.recipeAIResponse}}`

Focusing on this node:
![[Pasted image 20250520060835.png]]

Configure File Card:
- Search for "Capture" to find the File Card:
  ![[Pasted image 20250520060453.png]]
  - The Raw File will send a message to the user (the purpose is to ask them to upload a file). Then behind the scene, the file will be uploaded to Botpress' Cloud server to make it an online file that can be accessed. And at last, the URl gets saved to `recipeFileUrl` as configured here:
    ![[Pasted image 20250520060726.png]]
- The message can be:
```
Hi, this is Weng's Recipe AI. 

Feed me a recipe in PDF, text, md, or word document. Then ask me questions. 

Example questions:
- Can I improve the recipe? Taste or pricing
- Are there other variations
```


---

Focusing on the next node:
![[Pasted image 20250520060851.png]]

Configure Text Card
- Message just tells user that their file is uploaded:
```
You've uploaded:

{{workflow.recipeFileUrl}}
```

Configure Execute Code Card:
- If you look back at the chat screenshot, you'll see that the URL reported back is malformed (this is a Botpress Cloud bug as of 5/2025). This code will correct the malformed URL. Then it will try to read the file's text, saving it to a workflow variable `recipeFileContent`
```
// Fix Botpress file upload url report glitch
let url = workflow.recipeFileUrl
url = url.replaceAll("https//", "https://")

// Get title value from the API
const response = await axios.get(url)
const content = response.data

// Assign the extracted title to the workflow variable
workflow.recipeFileContent = content
```

Configure Raw Input Card:
- The Raw Input Card sends a message to the user `I'm ready for your questions` and will capture the user's question as a variable `workflow.recipeQuestion`
- Looks like
	![[Pasted image 20250520061448.png]]


---

Almost done! Let's focus on the final node:
![[Pasted image 20250520062053.png]]

Configure AI Generate Text Card:
- To search for the card, search "AI":
  ![[Pasted image 20250520062137.png]]
- Your AI Generate Text prompt can be:
	```
	Please read the following recipe. It should be a recipe. If this is NOT a recipe, tell user that this is not recognized as a recipe. If it IS a recipe, then answer the {{workflow.recipeQuestion}}. 
	
	Recipe:
	"""
	{{workflow.recipeFileContent}}
	"""
	```
- Explanation of the prompt: The prompt contains the recipe text and the user question, and per the prompt, the AI will only answer the question if the file is a recipe, but otherwise the AI tells the user that this is not a recipe file. 
- The AI response saves into variable `recipeAIResponse`  (Unfortunately, the AI card does not have an option to just send the message to the user's chat):
  ![[Pasted image 20250520062340.png]]

Configure Text Card
- Just send message to user chat using Text Card. You're exactly telling the user what the AI said:
  `{{workflow.recipeAIResponse}}`

Done!

Here’s a **classic Roman-style Spaghetti alla Carbonara** recipe — simple, authentic, and creamy *without* any cream.

---

### 🍝 **Spaghetti alla Carbonara (Authentic Recipe)**

#### ✅ Ingredients (Serves 2)

* **200g (7 oz) spaghetti**
* **100g (3.5 oz) guanciale** (or pancetta as a substitute)
* **2 large egg yolks** + **1 whole egg**
* **50g (1.75 oz) Pecorino Romano**, finely grated
* **Freshly ground black pepper**
* **Salt** (for pasta water)

---

#### 👨‍🍳 Instructions

1. **Boil the pasta water**

   * Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

2. **Prep the guanciale**

   * Cut guanciale into short strips or small cubes.
   * Place in a cold pan and cook over medium heat until golden and crisp (about 5–7 min). Turn off heat and leave it in the pan.

3. **Whisk the eggs and cheese**

   * In a bowl, whisk **2 yolks + 1 whole egg**.
   * Add **most of the grated Pecorino** (save some for garnish).
   * Add a good amount of black pepper and mix well. Set aside.

4. **Cook the pasta**

   * Add spaghetti to the boiling water and cook **1 minute short of al dente**.
   * Reserve **½ cup pasta water**, then drain the pasta.

5. **Combine**

   * Add hot pasta to the pan with guanciale (off heat).
   * Quickly stir to coat pasta in the fat.
   * Wait 30 seconds to cool slightly, then pour in the egg-cheese mixture while **tossing rapidly** to avoid scrambling the eggs.
   * Add a little **reserved pasta water** as needed to make a creamy, glossy sauce.

6. **Serve immediately**

   * Top with extra Pecorino and cracked pepper.

---

#### 🔥 Tips for Success

* **No cream** — the creaminess comes from emulsifying egg, cheese, and pasta water.
* **Guanciale > Pancetta > Bacon** (in order of authenticity).
* Stir constantly while adding the egg mixture to avoid curdling.
* Use **Pecorino Romano** (not Parmigiano) for true Roman flavor.

Test with a non-recipe file. AI should deny helping you after you ask a question:
```
In a quiet town tucked between hills, there lived a shoemaker named Eli who never danced.

Every evening, he watched from his shop window as couples twirled in the square, music floating through the breeze like a secret meant for someone else. Eli's hands were steady with leather and laces, but his feet had forgotten how to feel light.

One night, a girl with wind-tangled hair burst into his shop just before closing.

“My shoe broke,” she said, holding out a worn ballet slipper.

Eli fixed it silently, his fingers quick, his eyes on the floor.

“Do you dance?” she asked, studying him.

He laughed softly. “Not anymore.”

“Then tonight, you should,” she said. “No one’s watching as closely as you think.”

And just like that, she ran barefoot into the square.

Eli followed. Not with courage, but with curiosity.

The music swelled. The stars leaned closer.

And for the first time in years, Eli stepped forward—not to fix, but to feel.

He danced.
