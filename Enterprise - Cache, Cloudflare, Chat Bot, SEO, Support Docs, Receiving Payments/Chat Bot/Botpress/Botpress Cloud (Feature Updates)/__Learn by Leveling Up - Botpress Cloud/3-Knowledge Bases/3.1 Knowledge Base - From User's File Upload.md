If you take a look at the Chat interface, at the bottom left is a plus "+" button to upload files:

Let's create a Recipe AI Chat that lets users upload a recipe, then ask the AI any questions about that recipe.

The file the user uploads becomes a temporary Knowledge Base that the AI will refer to for future questions. The user will be prompted to ask questions, then we pass those questions to AI to answer about the recipe file.

In addition, we need to have the AI validate that the file is actually a recipe. It should end the conversation saying that it doesn't recognize a recipe.
