As of 5/2025, the current UI for adjusting Expression card is tricky. By default, it has the Label and the Condition AI generated. This locks you out of manually entering into the fields.

We want to turn off AI so we can configure directly. But turning off the AI is tricky.

The UI quirk is that you can't turn off AI at the label. You turn off the AI by:

**First toggling off Condition's blue icon:** (Not turning off Label's AI first)

TLDR:
Blue icon means AI is "ON". Black icon means AI is "OFF". You can turn off all AI fields by turning off the Condition's AI - that's the quirk.
