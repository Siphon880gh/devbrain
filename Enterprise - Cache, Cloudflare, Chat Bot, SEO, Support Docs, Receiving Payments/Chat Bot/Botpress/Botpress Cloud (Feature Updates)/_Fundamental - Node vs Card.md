Nodes:

Here we have two nodes - Start and End.
We right-clicked to be able to create either a Standard Node or an Autonomous Node:

Then we connect them:

But if we open the Chat Emulator now, there's nothing impressive happening. We have to fill in what happens at each Standard Node or Autonomous Node with cards

Cards:

There are various. Text (sends a text to User's Chat), Raw Input / Multiple Choices (How the user responds), are some of the more frequently used.

Here the Standard Node gets a Text Card that just greets the user back and then says bye. Nothing impressive:

Opening the chat bot, the conversation goes like this:

Adding Cards:

You can search Cards by clicking "Add Card" at any Standard node

Another way is you drag mouse over to the right on the "Main" or any workflow item to open Cards (no click and dragging, just dragging):
