### Prototyping Stage Message

Most agencies charge thousands of dollars to build a chatbot. In this case, we’re creating a lean MVP — something fast, functional, and cost-effective.

**We have chosen Botpress for you:**

Botpress is one of the leading platforms in the enterprise chatbot space. It’s significantly more affordable than heavyweight tools like Intercom’s Fin or IBM Watson, while offering more robust features than simpler builders like Chatfuel or ChatAssistant — which are great for basic bots but fall short when it comes to natural language understanding or AI flexibility.

The closest alternative is **Rasa**, another powerful open-source tool. However, Rasa is highly code-driven. Unless your team includes developers ready to manage both the backend logic and frontend flow, it can be a heavy lift for MVPs or rapid prototyping.

How does this compare to Chatling? Chatling is a solid choice for non-technical users, offering a clean, template-driven setup that's easy to launch quickly. However, it lacks the extensibility and customization depth needed for complex workflows or enterprise use cases. Botpress is more suitable when future scalability, logic handling, and platform control matter.

How does it compare with Voiceflow? Voiceflow is well-regarded for its intuitive interface, making it a strong choice for non-technical teams and beginners. It offers a more generous free plan and supports telephony as a built-in channel — something Botpress currently lacks, though this can often be addressed with custom development. However, Botpress has the edge when it comes to integrations, offering over 50 direct connectors that Voiceflow does not currently match.

Botpress hits the sweet spot:
- Drag-and-drop simplicity for quick setups
- Deep customization options when you need them
- Affordable pricing — including a free tier — with enterprise-level capabilities

It's the ideal platform to build something useful now, with room to scale later.

### Rest of the Work Message

**You have a couple of options depending on how much customization you need:**

**1. Fully Free (Self-Hosted, Legacy Botpress):**  
This older, self-hosted version is completely free to use, but comes with trade-offs. Customization is more manual and time-consuming, and the AI capabilities are limited — it struggles to adapt when users go off-script. It’s also not actively maintained, so integrations with platforms like WhatsApp or Messenger are either missing or require heavy workarounds.

**2. Modern Cloud Version (Free + Paid Tiers):**  
Botpress now offers a modern cloud platform with usage-based pricing — **but they also provide a generous forever-free tier** that resets monthly. This makes it easy to test, iterate, and even launch a working chatbot without upfront costs.

The cloud version includes **AI-driven conversation handling**, which means the bot can intelligently respond to unexpected input and carry on natural interactions. It also has a user-friendly visual interface and supports easy integration with messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Messenger, or web widgets.
