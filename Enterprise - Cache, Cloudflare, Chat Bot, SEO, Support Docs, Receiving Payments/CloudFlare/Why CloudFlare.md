Many companies take advantage of Cloudflare’s free features, including SSL certificates, basic DDoS protection, IP blocking, and human verification (to prevent automated bots from scraping your content). Even on the free plan, Cloudflare provides basic analytics—showing total visits, unique visitors, and the countries they’re coming from.

- For a table comparison of the types of visitor stats among the free versus paid tiers, refer to [[Cloudflare Visitor Statistics - Free vs Paid Plans]]

Larger businesses often upgrade to paid plans to unlock features like regional caching, though basic caching is available on all tiers. If you're on the **Pro Plan**, Cloudflare’s **Polish** feature can automatically optimize and compress images—using either **lossless** or **lossy** compression—to reduce file sizes, save bandwidth, and improve page load times.

Additionally, Cloudflare maintains a global IP reputation system. If an IP address has already been verified as safe on another Cloudflare-protected site, that trust can carry over—streamlining access and reducing friction for legitimate users. At the same time, it helps flag suspicious behavior such as VPN usage or rapid IP rotation often associated with scraping or attacks.
