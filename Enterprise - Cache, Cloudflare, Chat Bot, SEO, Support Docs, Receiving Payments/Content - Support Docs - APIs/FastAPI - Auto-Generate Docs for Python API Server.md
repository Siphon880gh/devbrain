Here‚Äôs your **reorganized and polished FastAPI article**, with renamed and reordered sections for a more intuitive flow:

## ‚ö° What is FastAPI?

[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a **modern, high-performance Python web framework** built specifically for building APIs. One of its most powerful features? You can just define your endpoints using Python type hints ‚Äî and it will **automatically generate beautiful, interactive API documentation**.

FastAPI is designed for both speed and simplicity. Whether you're building internal tools, developer-facing APIs, or machine learning-powered microservices, it helps you build production-ready backends fast.

---

## üß© When to Use FastAPI

Use FastAPI if:

- You want clean, **self-documenting APIs**
- You prefer **type-safe development** with Python
- You‚Äôre building **asynchronous apps** (e.g. WebSockets, streaming, background tasks)
- You need **auto-generated documentation** your team or clients can test immediately
- You‚Äôre building backend services for frontend teams, ML workflows, or microservices

FastAPI is especially strong for modern API-centric development in fast-moving teams.

---

## üí∞ Free

FastAPI is **free and open source**, licensed under MIT.  
There are no commercial tiers ‚Äî you only pay for whatever infrastructure or services you choose to host it on (e.g., cloud providers, databases, CI/CD).

---

## üß™ Getting Started

Install FastAPI and an ASGI server like Uvicorn:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

Create a file `main.py`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Welcome to FastAPI"}
```

Run your API:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Then open your browser and visit:

- [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) ‚Üí Swagger UI
- [http://localhost:8000/redoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc) ‚Üí ReDoc

## üß† Syntax: Type-Hint Driven APIs

FastAPI relies on **Python‚Äôs type hints** to:

- Automatically validate incoming requests
- Generate OpenAPI/JSON Schema documentation
- Define query parameters, path variables, and request/response models

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/greet")
def greet(name: str):
    return {"message": f"Hello, {name}!"}
```

Here, `name: str` means FastAPI will expect a `name` query parameter as a string. This single line enables full validation **and** adds it to your API docs.

This makes your code **self-validating**, **self-documenting**, and **easy to reason about**.

---

## üìú Auto-Generated Documentation

FastAPI generates two documentation interfaces using your code as the source of truth:

- **Swagger UI** at `/docs` ‚Äì Interactive testing and visualization
- **ReDoc** at `/redoc` ‚Äì Clean, readable API reference

These are powered by your app‚Äôs OpenAPI schema, which FastAPI creates on the fly from your routes, parameters, and models.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuring Swagger UI and ReDoc

You can fully control the behavior and location of the documentation UIs:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI(
    title="My API",
    description="A FastAPI-powered service",
    version="1.0.0",
    docs_url="/docs",           # Swagger UI path
    redoc_url="/redoc",         # ReDoc path
    openapi_url="/openapi.json" # Raw schema
)
```

Want to disable Swagger UI or ReDoc?

```python
app = FastAPI(
    docs_url=None,              # disables Swagger UI
    redoc_url="/documentation"  # custom path for ReDoc
)
```

This is helpful for customizing URLs, tightening security, or white-labeling public-facing docs.

## üîß Under the Hood: Starlette + Pydantic

FastAPI builds on two best-in-class Python libraries:

- **[Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/):** A lightning-fast ASGI toolkit for routing, middleware, background tasks, and WebSockets. It‚Äôs what powers FastAPI‚Äôs core server performance.
- **[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/):** A type-safe data validation library that uses Python type annotations to enforce data structure and generate schemas. It powers request/response validation and schema generation in FastAPI.

These libraries are powerful in their own right ‚Äî FastAPI simply unifies them with developer-friendly syntax and tooling.

---

## üì¶ Ecosystem & Add-ons

FastAPI plays well with other modern tools:

- **SQLModel** ‚Äì A type-safe ORM built by FastAPI‚Äôs creator
- **Typer** ‚Äì Command-line app builder using the same type-hint philosophy
- **FastAPI Users** ‚Äì Drop-in user authentication system (OAuth2, JWT, email)

Common stack:
- **Uvicorn** ‚Äì ASGI server (often used with Gunicorn in production)
- **SQLAlchemy**, **Tortoise ORM**, or **MongoEngine**
- **Celery** ‚Äì For background task queues
- **Docker** ‚Äì For deployment and microservices
