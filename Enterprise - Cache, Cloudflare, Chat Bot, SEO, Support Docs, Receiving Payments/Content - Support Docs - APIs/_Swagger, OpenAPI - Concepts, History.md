## What is OpenAPI?

**OpenAPI** is a **specification** for describing RESTful APIs in a standardized, machine-readable format (usually in JSON or YAML). It defines how endpoints behave, what parameters they take, what responses they return, and more — allowing both humans and software to understand and interact with APIs.

It is not an implementation or a product — it's a **specification (a convention)**.

## Is Swagger related to OpenAPI?

Yes. Originally, Swagger was the name of both:

- the **specification** (for describing REST APIs), and
    
- the **tools** built around it (like Swagger UI, Editor, Codegen).
    

Later, the Swagger spec was donated to the OpenAPI Initiative (under the Linux Foundation) and renamed to **OpenAPI Specification (OAS)**.

Today:

- **OpenAPI** = the specification
    
- **Swagger** = a set of tools that work with OpenAPI (maintained by SmartBear)

## What is Swagger used for?

Swagger provides tools for:

- **Documenting** APIs (via Swagger UI)
    
- **Testing** and interacting with APIs through a web interface
    
- **Generating code** (clients, servers, SDKs) from an OpenAPI spec
    
- **Creating** OpenAPI specs via a user-friendly editor
