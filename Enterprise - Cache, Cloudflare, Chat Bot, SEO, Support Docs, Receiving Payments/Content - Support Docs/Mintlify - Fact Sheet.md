## 💰 Pricing (as of June 2025)

Mintlify’s pricing model is focused on **editor seats**, which means costs scale with the number of team members writing or editing documentation.

- ✅ **Free plan:** Very limited in functionality — best for individual developers exploring the platform.
    
- 💼 **Starter tier:** Starts at **$150/month**, indicating a clear focus on small teams or startups.
    
- 🏢 **Enterprise plans:** Likely custom-priced and packed with features for scaling, analytics, security, and workflow controls.
    

This pricing structure suggests that Mintlify is positioned for **high-growth teams** or **documentation-heavy products**, rather than hobbyist or early bootstrappers.
