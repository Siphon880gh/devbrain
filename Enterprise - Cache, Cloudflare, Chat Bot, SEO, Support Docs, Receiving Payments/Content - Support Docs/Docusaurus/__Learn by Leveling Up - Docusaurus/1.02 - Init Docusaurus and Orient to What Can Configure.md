Create boilerplate
```
npx create-docusaurus@latest app classic
```

First orientate yourself:
sidebar.js:
- allows automatically generate the sidebar of docs and folders from /docs folder
- Or you manually code it, allowing you to skip documents and/or rearrange them

```
....  
const sidebars = {  
  // By default, Docusaurus generates a sidebar from the docs folder structure  
  tutorialSidebar: [{type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.'}],  
  
  // But you can create a sidebar manually  
  /*  
  tutorialSidebar: [  
    'intro',  
    'hello',  
    {  
      type: 'category',  
      label: 'Tutorial',  
      items: ['tutorial-basics/create-a-document'],  
    },  
  ],  
   */  
};
```

^ This is not the only way to rearrange documents out of their alphabetical order - don't worry. You can keep autogenerated.

Please leave sidebars autogenerated for now. The future of this tutorial relies on sidebar being autogenerated.
