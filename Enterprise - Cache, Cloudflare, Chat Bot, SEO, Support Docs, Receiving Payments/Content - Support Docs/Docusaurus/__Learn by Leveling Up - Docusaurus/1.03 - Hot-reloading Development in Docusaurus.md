Modify the look? Run
```
npm run start
```

And see the changes live.

`docusaurus.config`:
- Go to the section `config.themeConfig.navbar.items`
- That's the navbar at the top
- Lets make Tutorial navbar item look funny:
	```
	items: [  
	  {  
		type: 'docSidebar',  
		sidebarId: 'tutorialSidebar',  
		position: 'left',  
		label: 'TUTORIAL!',  
	  },
	```

With hot reloading, now immediately looks like (see the top navbar item changed from "Tutorial" to "TUTORIAL!")

You can decide to remove the Blog navbar item if your support docs site wont have a blog (usually doesn't).
