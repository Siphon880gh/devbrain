If you want a **public-facing status page** like [status.hrflow.ai](https://status.hrflow.ai/), there are several tools that make this easy—even for free. These pages let your users know about service uptime, downtime, and incidents without opening a support ticket.


## ✅ Hyperping

## 🔴 Not Offered Natively: AWS & Cloudflare

### 🔴 AWS (Amazon Web Services)

As of **June 2025**, AWS does **not** provide a hosted public status page for your services. It only offers:
- ✅ [Service Health Dashboard](https://status.aws.amazon.com/) (for AWS infrastructure only)
- ✅ Personal Health Dashboard (visible only in your account)
- ❌ No way to show **your app’s status** to end users without building it yourself

---

### 🔴 Cloudflare

Cloudflare also does **not** offer a turnkey status page solution for your applications. However, you do get:
- ✅ Health Checks for monitoring origin servers
- ✅ Cloudflare Workers and KV for building custom solutions
- ❌ No plug-and-play public status page system like Hyperping or Statuspage

---

## 🛠️ Build-Your-Own (Developer Setup Required)

If you're a developer—or have one on the team—you can roll your own public status page with full control over styling, logic, and hosting.

### ✅ Cloudflare Workers

You can build and deploy a status page using:
- [eidam/cf-workers-status-page](https://github.com/eidam/cf-workers-status-page)
- Workers + KV/D1 + Cron Triggers
- No external infrastructure required
- Custom domains (e.g. `status.example.com`)  

### ✅ AWS Lambda

Create your own public status dashboard using:
- AWS Lambda (health-check logic)
- API Gateway + S3 (host public frontend)
- DynamoDB or JSON (store results)
- CloudWatch Events (to run on a schedule)

More flexible, but requires wiring up each piece manually.
