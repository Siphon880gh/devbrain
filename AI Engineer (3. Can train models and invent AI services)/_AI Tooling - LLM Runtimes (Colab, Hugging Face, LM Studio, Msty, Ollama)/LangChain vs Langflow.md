### **LangChain vs LangFlow**

|Feature|**LangChain**|**LangFlow**|
|---|---|---|
|**Overview**|A powerful framework for building applications with LLMs through code.|A visual low-code/no-code tool for building LLM workflows.|
|**Coding Approach**|Code-centric (Python/JavaScript). Full flexibility and control.|Visual flow editor. Minimal coding required, suited for non-devs or quick prototyping.|
|**Target Audience**|Developers, researchers, engineers.|Product teams, business analysts, technical designers.|
|**Customization**|Highly customizable; access to all components.|Customization available via UI and block parameters; less flexible than raw code.|
|**Use Cases**|Fine-tuned agent design, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), data chaining, API integrations, custom logic.|Quickly prototyping or deploying chatbots, question-answering systems, or RAG pipelines using drag-and-drop blocks.|
|**Interface**|Code in IDEs or notebooks.|Web-based graphical UI with flow diagrams.|
|**Deployment**|Requires manual deployment and environment setup.|Offers one-click deployment, export options, and easy testing.|
|**Extensibility**|Unlimited — can build or integrate anything using Python.|Limited to the blocks and components available (but growing).|
|**Built on LangChain**|N/A|✅ **Built on top of LangChain**: It leverages the power of LangChain while offering a visual, low-code approach.|

### Summary

- Use **LangChain** when you need **full control**, advanced logic, and are comfortable coding.
- Use **LangFlow** when you want to **prototype fast**, **visualize workflows**, or **build without deep coding** — while still benefiting from the underlying power of LangChain.
