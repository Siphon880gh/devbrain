**Ollama** is a wrapper and runtime designed to simplify the deployment and interaction with **Llama.cpp**, which is a high-performance, inference-optimized implementation of Meta’s LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) models.

**Llama.cpp** (and by extension, **Ollama**) is **not limited to just LLaMA models**. While it was originally built to run Meta’s **LLaMA** models efficiently on consumer hardware, it has since been extended to support **multiple open-source large language models (LLMs)**.
### Key Features of **Ollama**:

- **Easier Model Management**: Provides a simple way to download, run, and manage LLM models on local machines.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Uses Llama.cpp under the hood for efficient CPU/GPU inference.
- **API Interface**: Offers a local API for interacting with LLaMA models in applications.
- **Simplified Usage**: Requires minimal setup compared to running Llama.cpp manually.
- **Custom Models**: Allows fine-tuning and running different open-source LLMs with minimal configuration.

### How Ollama Relates to Llama.cpp:

- **Llama.cpp** is a **low-level** C++ implementation optimized for fast inference, supporting GGUF quantized models.
- **Ollama** wraps around Llama.cpp to provide a **high-level interface** with additional usability improvements.

\*Local Inference?

**Local inference** refers to running a machine learning model (such as LLaMA, GPT, or Stable Diffusion) **on your own device** (e.g., your PC, server, or edge device) rather than relying on cloud-based services like OpenAI, Hugging Face, or Google Cloud.
