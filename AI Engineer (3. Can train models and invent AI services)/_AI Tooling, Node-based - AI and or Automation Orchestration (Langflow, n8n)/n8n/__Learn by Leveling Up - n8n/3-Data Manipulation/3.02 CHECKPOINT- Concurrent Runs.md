Referring to the previous lesson [[3.01 Enrich CRM lead data - Merge Node]]:

Did you notice that the Schedule Trigger branches out to two nodes? You can branch out from mostly any nodes. This makes the workflow run multiple branches simultaneously.

You can just drag any node's outlet to create another connector:

On letting go, you're asked to choose a new node. Here we chose another "No operation" node:

Here's a more complicated branching that diverges AND converges:

^You see that the bottom right NO4 node can potentially receive data from two nodes. Does this sound familiar? Going back to the previous lesson's workflow, we had two mocked data inputting into a Merge node:

The merge node can make sure both inputs are treated as one input:
