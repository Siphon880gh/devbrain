Sign up for SERP API at [https://serpapi.com/pricing](https://serpapi.com/pricing)  

You will create a SerpAPI node that relies on the API key you get from signing up at SerpAPI

This service is not entirely free. Free accounts get 100 searches a month. Higher paid tiers get drastically more searches per month: https://serpapi.com/pricing

You'll need to signup and verify both email and phone number. If you don't trust the company, you can use a temporarily Google Voice number. You can keep this number forever as long as you keep it active (call/text 3 months at a time)

Get your API key from SerpAPI

Then back at n8n, search for serAPI official node to add - and add Google Search (Yes it can do a lot more than Google Search):

Workflow so far:
![[Pasted image 20250610032554.png]]

Double click SerpAPI so we can set up and run execute step.

Create SerpAPI account credential from inside SerpAPI's node settings or at the Credentials page for n8n. It should involve just the API key that you obtained from SerpAPI.com's actual website. Regardless, make sure to select your SerpiAPI account credential in the dropdown.

Then set the search query to: `video api services` and click run execute step. It'll run the entire workflow up to this point and give you the results

Note that `organic_results[0]`, `organic_results[1]`, etc are each search result is

But note that before those organic results are metadata and rich search result data:

Let's continue the pipeline to prune away that irrelevant data:
![[Pasted image 20250702024219.png]]

^ The Code node was renamed to Data Pruning

Data Pruning code is:
```
let prunedIntoInputs = []

// Loop over search results
for (const result of $input.first().json.organic_results) {
  const {title, link} = result;
  prunedIntoInputs.push({
    title,
    link
  });
}

return prunedIntoInputs;
```

Now your data can be used as multiple iterable inputs into n8n nodes (recall that in an array, the root level objects are treated as inputs):
![[Pasted image 20250702024331.png]]

At the top right of the SerpAPI Dashboard (https://serpapi.com/dashboard), you can see how many requests you can do. At free tier, I get 100 requests a month:
- A request is worth 10 search results, but only counts as using one credit
- In this example, the SerpAPI has reached out to get results 7 times.

That's it! That's the basics of using SerpAPI. On the next tutorial, we will learn a different service that scrapes Google Search Results.

Pro Tip - Dynamic Search

You can dynamically generate the search terms

Let's say you have an AI bot that recommend search terms based on user use case. Let's say the user wants to know what are some anti-aging strategies. The AI bot recommended (with an "Structured Output Parser" that makes sure the AI performs as prompted to respond with an array of objects for each search recommendation):
- systematic literature review on anti-aging
- anti-aging news 2025
- anti-aging tips from celebrity

This gives you more use cases.

Pro Tip - SerpAPI's Other Use Cases

Don't forget: SerpAPI can do more than Google search results. Recall that when adding the node, you were presented with many types of searching services! It won't hurt to explore what those other services are or make a mental note what they are specifically.
