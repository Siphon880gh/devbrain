In settings make sure to add community plugin "@bitovi/n8n-nodes-google-search"
![[Pasted image 20250702025415.png]]

To actually find the node at the canvas, you search for "Google Search":

Your workflow now looks like:

> [!note] You might ask, in the future how do I know the node's community name?
> 
> Click docs inside the node:
> ![[Pasted image 20250702025951.png]]
> 
> That opens https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bitovi/n8n-nodes-google-search, which confirms that is that community plugin.

Let's now make sure you setup the credential to the Google Search community node:
![[Pasted image 20250702141505.png]]

You need to setup the Google Cloud Console's Google Custom Search API Key **AND** a programmable search ID:
![[Pasted image 20250702141622.png]]

Visit the two links (copy and paste into web browser) for your convenience to visit the programmablesearchengine dashboard and the Google Cloud Console dashboard to obtain the two credentials.

> [!note] How to obtain the two credentials (API Key and programmablesearch id)
> 
> **1. Setup Google Custom Search API at google cloud:**
> Go to the Google Cloud Console:
> [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
> 
> Visit your project/app. If you do not have a project/app, create one:
> Eg. n8n-Google-Search
> ![[Pasted image 20250702153642.png]]
> 
> Search for and enable your specific API service that your n8n node needs: 
> Eg. Custom Search API
> ![[Pasted image 20250702142018.png]]
> ^ Make sure you have Custom Search API enabled!
> 
> Go into that API's dashboard:
> ![[Pasted image 20250702142053.png]]
> 
> Left of the API's dashboard is Credentials tab. Make sure to open that:
> ![[Pasted image 20250607035640.png]]
> 
> Create an API Key:
> ![[Pasted image 20250607031145.png]]
> 
> Specifically, you click "+ Create credentials" -> API Key:
> ![[Pasted image 20250607031239.png]]
> 
> Make sure to copy to a safe place:
> ![[Pasted image 20250607031402.png]]
> 
> You can see all the API keys created:
> ![[Pasted image 20250607031533.png]]
> 
> But notice there's an orange triangle warning icon. It says that you should restrict the API Key:
> ![[Pasted image 20250607031601.png]]
> 
> A common restriction is selecting which API service the key works with:
> ![[Pasted image 20250607031718.png]]
> 
> **2. Get Programmablesearch ID at**:
> https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/
> 
> Only one credential piece of information left:
> ![[Pasted image 20250702161612.png]]
> 
> You need a google search engine project/app to get the ID. Create it -
> Programmable Search Engine:
> [https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/)
> 
> You can list all projects/apps at:
> - You might see some:
>   [https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/all](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/all)
> - Or if you don't have one yet, you will see a clear path to creating a new project/app:
>   ![[Pasted image 20250702161807.png]]
> 
> You can just have it search the entire web
> ![[Pasted image 20250702161824.png]]
>
> This is next page confirming you've successfully created a new programmablesearch project/app
> ![[Pasted image 20250702161937.png]]
>
> Look for the public url **or** the search engine id. You **do not need** the code.:
> ![[Pasted image 20250702162016.png]]
> 
>  Doesn't matter which one you look at. The public url looks like:
> `https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=**********`
> ^ Where the `*****` is - that's the programmablesearch ID that we need at the n8n node's credential. The ID is an alphanumeric entry
> 
> Copy both credentials back to the n8n node's credential modal:
> - Note I obscured the ID.
