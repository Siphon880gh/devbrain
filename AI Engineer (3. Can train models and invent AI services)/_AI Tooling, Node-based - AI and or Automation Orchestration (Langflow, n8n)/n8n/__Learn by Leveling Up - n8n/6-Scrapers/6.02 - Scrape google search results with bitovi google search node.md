In settings make sure to add community plugin "@bitovi/n8n-nodes-google-search"
![[Pasted image 20250702025415.png]]

To actually find the node at the canvas, you search for "Google Search":

Your workflow now looks like:
![[Pasted image 20250702025916.png]]


> [!note] You might ask, in the future how do I know the node's community name?
> 
> Click docs inside the node:
> ![[Pasted image 20250702025951.png]]
> 
> That opens https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bitovi/n8n-nodes-google-search, which confirms that is that community plugin.

Let's now make sure you setup the credential to the Google Search community node:
![[Pasted image 20250702141505.png]]

You need to setup the Google Cloud Console's Google Custom Search API Key **AND** a programmable search ID:
![[Pasted image 20250702141622.png]]

Visit the two links (copy and paste into web browser) for your convenience to visit the programmablesearchengine dashboard and the Google Cloud Console dashboard to obtain the two credentials.

> [!note] How to obtain the two credentials (API Key and programmablesearch id)
> 
> **1. Setup Google Custom Search API at google cloud:**
> Go to the Google Cloud Console:
> [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
> 
> Visit your project/app. If you do not have a project/app, create one:
> Eg. n8n-Google-Search
> ![[Pasted image 20250702153642.png]]
> 
> Search for and enable your specific API service that your n8n node needs: 
> Eg. Custom Search API
> ![[Pasted image 20250702142018.png]]
> ^ Make sure you have Custom Search API enabled!
> 
> Go into that API's dashboard:
> ![[Pasted image 20250702142053.png]]
> 
> Left of the API's dashboard is Credentials tab. Make sure to open that:
> ![[Pasted image 20250607035640.png]]
> 
> Create an API Key:
> ![[Pasted image 20250607031145.png]]
> 
> Specifically, you click "+ Create credentials" -> API Key:
> ![[Pasted image 20250607031239.png]]
> 
> Make sure to copy to a safe place:
> ![[Pasted image 20250607031402.png]]
> 
> You can see all the API keys created:
> ![[Pasted image 20250607031533.png]]
> 
> But notice there's an orange triangle warning icon. It says that you should restrict the API Key:
> ![[Pasted image 20250607031601.png]]
> 
> A common restriction is selecting which API service the key works with:
> ![[Pasted image 20250607031718.png]]
> 
> **2. Get Programmablesearch ID at**:
> https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/
> 
> Only one credential piece of information left:
> ![[Pasted image 20250702161612.png]]
> 
> You need a google search engine project/app to get the ID. Create it -
> Programmable Search Engine:
> [https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/)
> 
> You can list all projects/apps at:
> - You might see some:
>   [https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/all](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/all)
> - Or if you don't have one yet, you will see a clear path to creating a new project/app:
>   ![[Pasted image 20250702161807.png]]
> 
> You can just have it search the entire web
> ![[Pasted image 20250702161824.png]]
>
> This is next page confirming you've successfully created a new programmablesearch project/app
> ![[Pasted image 20250702161937.png]]
>
> Look for the public url **or** the search engine id. You **do not need** the code.:
> ![[Pasted image 20250702162016.png]]
> 
>  Doesn't matter which one you look at. The public url looks like:
> `https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=**********`
> ^ Where the `*****` is - that's the programmablesearch ID that we need at the n8n node's credential. The ID is an alphanumeric entry
> 
> Copy both credentials back to the n8n node's credential modal:
> - Note I obscured the ID.

Let's go into the Google Search node. Let's search for cats. Leave alone the limit setting (default being 50):
![[Pasted image 20250702192507.png]]

It's an array of search result objects. This is already in the form that n8n likes (an array of object items) which the next node after the Google sSearch node can just treat each search result as an input.

---

If you go on Google Cloud Console Dashboard, you'll see that the 50 search results counted as 5 queries. This is reasonable because 10 search results counts as one query, just like if you were actually searching on google, then each page has 10 results. 
![[Pasted image 20250702193038.png]]

✅ Daily limit is correct to refer to.
As of July 2025, Google Custom Search API limits you to 100 free queries a day (so 100 x 10 = 1,000 search results in a day). https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview
![[Pasted image 20250702193015.png]]


❌ Daily limit is NOT correct to refer to.
You may see at programmablesearchengine.google.com that the quota is 100,000 a day. Although we do use your Programmablesearchengine ID, this quota does not apply to the API. 
![[Pasted image 20250702193227.png]] 

What happens when you run out of free queries in the day? Remember one query counts as 10 search results, so you get 100 queries or 1000 search results:
![[Pasted image 20250702193423.png]]

But if you connect your Google Custom Search API to a billing account, you can query beyond that 100 free queries a day limit. It costs $5 for 1000 additional queries. You are still capped at 10k queries per day. Per https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview

AFTER You connect billing, it could take upwards of 30mins for the api to actually stop returning empty and for the dashboard to update:
- Oh no, I associated a billing account to my API access but it still says I've reached quota and no search results are programmatically going through yet:
  ![[Pasted image 20250702193423.png]]

- After waiting about 30mins, the dashboard finally updates and I can finally see search results programmatically:
  ![[Pasted image 20250702194057.png]]

What happens when run out of queries? There is no runtime error to let you know you've ran out. It just returns blank:
`[{}]`

So you won't know if it returned blank because there's no search results for your keywords or that you ran beyond the queries limit.
