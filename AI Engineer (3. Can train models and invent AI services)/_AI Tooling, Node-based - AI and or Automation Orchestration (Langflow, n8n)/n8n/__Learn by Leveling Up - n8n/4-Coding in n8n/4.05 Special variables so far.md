As you can see from prior lessons, n8n has special variables to access the current input's data (`$json.YOUR_FIELD_NAME`). We advanced the index by reassigning to `$json.a + 1`

It could have been `$input.item.json.YOUR_FIELD_NAME` or `$input.item.json.a + 1`. At some point in n8n's updates, they created `$json` as a shortcut to `$input.item.json`.

You've also learned that you can access a previous node's output in the pipeline. We took advantage of that feature to create a node that assigns "workspace variables": `$('NODE NAME').....`. To expand further on that, it was more like `$('NODE NAME').first().json.YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME`. Why is it the first input and not the current input? Because we only returned an object in the workflow variables Code node, which will map the object to an array of objects representing an array of inputs that n8n nodes can iterate through. If you had used `$('NODE NAME').item.json.YOUR_FIELD_NAME`, it could potentially error if your node accessing that variable is not the first iteration (Let's say the node receives multiple inputs).

And while accessing a much earlier node can give you the current item and the first item, it can also give the `last()` item and `all()` items. The `all()` items could be very useful in certain cases, such as letting an AI Agent node know about all your inputs (make sure to Limit on the inputs so you dont pass the token limit). In the case of passing `all()` into the AI Agent, you would have to get the json string representation: `$('NODE NAME').all().toJsonString()`.

Now if you're just accessing at the current node, there are equivalent for getting all inputs, the first, the last, and the current:
- $input.all()
- $input.first()
- $input.last()
- $input.item

Note that `.item` is NOT a method. The `.all().toJsonString()` would've been used for the AI Agent if it's appropriate. However there are use cases for `.all()` without the conversion into string using `toJsonString()`: 
- You might add an extra node purely for visual clarityâ€”such as when splitting a flow into parallel branches, where you want nodes on both sides. In such cases, placing an additional node on one branch can help with layout or logic without disrupting or discarding the input from that point in the pipeline.
- Passing data through a Code node. Sometimes we just want to double check the data at a node that clearly delineates it's for the developer to double check:

Now if you only need the input's iteration index, that is `$itemIndex`, like discussed in the previous [[4.04 Adding 1 with special variable itemIndex]]. That is not to be confused with `$runIndex`. Also - inputIndex does not exist.
