You may find multi selecting not working. n8n does support multi-selecting nodes. It's just fuzzy about it, as of 6/2025.

On Mac, for example, you can multi-select by holding CMD then clicking the nodes. You may have nodes that immediately de-select from your selections. In that case, try multi-selecting by clicking at the **top border**.
