**Workflow Structure Guidelines**
- **📝 Instructions:**  
    Place clear usage instructions for the team at the _very top_ of the workflow. Use annotation nodes or a pinned comment to explain what the workflow does and how to trigger it.
- **🔁 Main Workflow Logic:**  
    Keep the _core logic and operations near the top_ section of the canvas. This includes API calls, data transformations, and business rules.
- **🐞 Debugging / Logging:**  
    Place all debugging, logging, or test branches _towards the bottom_. Clearly label these sections to avoid confusion with the production flow.
