**n8n**, **Flowise**, and **Langflow** are all visual, low-code platforms designed to orchestrate workflows‚Äîbut each has its own strengths, focus areas, and ideal use cases.

---

### üîÅ n8n ‚Äì General-Purpose Workflow Automation

- **Focus:** General automation and integration across services (Zapier-style).
    
- **Strengths:**
    
    - 500+ service integrations (APIs, webhooks, CRMs, databases, etc.)
        
    - Powerful logic nodes (IF/ELSE, loops, retries)
        
    - Cron jobs, error handling, and versioning
        
- **Weaknesses:**
    
    - Lacks native support for LLMs or agent-based workflows (requires manual setup)
        
- **Best for:**
    
    - Automating SaaS tasks, data syncing, scraping, and backend logic flows

### üß† Flowise ‚Äì Visual LLM Orchestration (LangChain UI)

- **Focus:** AI agent development using LangChain under the hood
    
- **Strengths:**
    
    - Drag-and-drop builder for LLM chains, prompts, tools, memory
        
    - Ideal for building GPT-style chatbots or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) flows
        
    - Native support for OpenAI, Pinecone, HuggingFace, etc.
        
- **Weaknesses:**
    
    - Limited integrations outside the LLM ecosystem
        
    - Can become inflexible for non-AI workflows
        
- **Best for:**
    
    - Prototyping and deploying AI chatbots and tool-using agents

### üß© Langflow ‚Äì Modular LLM Workflows with Agent Support

- **Focus:** Building modular, agent-like AI apps with flexible control over logic
    
- **Strengths:**
    
    - Clean, modern UI built on LangChain (like Flowise)
        
    - Better customization of tools, chains, and memory management
        
    - Active support for multi-agent setups and advanced RAG workflows
        
- **Weaknesses:**
    
    - Still evolving; fewer plug-and-play integrations than n8n
    - As of 5/2025, barely adding Google BigQuery support
    
- **Best for:**    
    - Developers looking to deeply customize LLM workflows and deploy scalable AI agents

### ü§î When to Choose What?

- **Use n8n if** you need broad integrations, complex logic flows, and general workflow automation.
- **Use Flowise if** you're building AI agents or LLM apps and want a simple drag-and-drop UI.
- **Use Langflow if** you're developing more advanced or multi-agent LLM workflows and need a highly modular, customizable platform.
