GOAL: RAG test with a small text file first. We use small text embedding model from OpenAI. This is to limit cost and so we can quickly see that the RAG works. After working, you can adapt it for multiple PDF files (Hint: Use "Directory" component instead of "File" component)

---


Open the RAG starter template. You'll be presented with a "1. Load Data Flow" and "2. Retrieve Flow":
- Btw the "Parse Data" component is now renamed to "Data to Message" component in Lang Flow's library. 
![](KxjigDH.png)

Sneak peak:
- We will load in you PDFs or text files at "1. Load Data Flow"
- Then at "2. Retrieve Flow", we can query the PDFs or text files about anything

The external connections needed:
- You'd need an external text embedding model - OpenAI offers one.
- You also need a vector database. DataStax offers a free 10gb AstraDB.

These are the credentials and database/collection details missing:
- At Loading (aka Load file): Missing API key at OpenAI text embedding model, missing token / database name / collection name at AstraDB vector database.
- At Retrieval (aka Query): Same missing items, plus missing API key for OpenAI LLM chat model.

**Quick Orientation:**
- At loading data, your file is chunked over to a text embedding model that knows how to vectorize your words into a queryable vector database. It saves the vectors to your queryable vector database.
- At retrieval (aka prompting), your Chat Input will search for the relevant answers in the queryable vector database, using the same text embedding model to do so. The relevant answer (aka variable `{context}` ) and your Chat Input (aka variable `{question}` ) gets passed into ChatGPT model, then it rewords the combined text into a prompt response. The only generative part was from AstraDB, and ChatGPT was use for transformation (rewording). Here’s ChatGPT’s transformation work:
```
{context}

---

Given the context above, answer the question as best as possible.

Question: {question}

Answer: 
```

  Remember you must first ingest the data (which enhances the AI with your documents, usually by you loading documents in), before you can retrieve (aka prompt the model!). That is RAG - Retrieval-augmented generation.

**Get API Key for Text embedding model and ChatGPT**

Get your API key for your project at platform.openai.com

Make sure to enable the text embedding models as well as the ChatGPT model you'll be using. For our example, we will use a small text embedding model:
[https://platform.openai.com/settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings)
![[Pasted image 20250210234531.png]]


**Enter** your API key at the LangFlow canvas, specifically at:
- Load flow's text embedding model
- Retrieval flow's text embedding model and ChatGPT model

---

**Get AstraDB connection details**

https://astra.datastax.com/
Get Free.
What free means
- for the first 10GB
- when inactive, it takes minutes to warm up the database again (meanwhile, will fail)

**Create database** at astradb web dashboard. You can name it something like "test" or something more distinguishable for your RAG use case. It will pend finish initializing. Wait for it to finish. Could take minutes.

Get **application token** under the database:
![[Pasted image 20250210234939.png]]

**DO NOT** create the collection at AstraDB web dashboard. We will create the collection through LangFlow (LangFlow will properly structure your collection at an api call to AstraDB under the hood). 
- FYI: If you do create the collection manually at AstralDB web dashboard, you have to structure the collection correctly including having a content field and including selecting it to be structured for the same text embedding model (default is Nvidia instead of OpenAI text embeddings) and you may need to use their CQL console to do so.

**Enter** your token and database name at the LangFlow canvas, specifically at:
- Load flow's AstraDB component
- Retrieval flow's AstraDB component
- **LEAVE ALONE** collection name

---

**Double check the API and DB details are entered**

Load flow looks like:
![[Pasted image 20250211020132.png]]

Retrieval flow looks like:
![[Pasted image 20250211020456.png]]

---


**Have Langflow create the AstraDB collection**

At Loading and Retrieval, your AstraDB component should be filled in at the token and database name fields. For this tutorial, I've named the database name "test":
![[Pasted image 20250210235509.png]]

^FYI: Note that not ALL of the inputs need to be connected. Regardless of Load flow or Retrieval flow, the same inputs are available because there is only one version of the AstraDB component. What mattered is which inputs are connected to and then empty fields are ignored

Let's go into Collection to type in a collection name. We will name it "name" or you can name it for your RAG use case:
![[Pasted image 20250210235651.png]]

This will have LangFlow automatically create the collection for you at AstraDB because the collection doesn't exist there. That is fine.

At Load flow's File, browse for the txt file:
![[Pasted image 20250211014124.png]]

Run the Load flow by pressing the play at the farthest right component, thereby "ingesting" the data into the vector collection for later "retrieval" or querying:

See if there are errors. There is an error if the Search Results icon changed red:
![[Pasted image 20250211014751.png]]

Click Search results to see what happened. Likely it'll be OpenAI errors if anything:
- [[Langflow OpenAI Error - Exceeded your current quota]]
- [[Langflow OpenAI Error - Access to model]]

**Retrieve/query**

CHECK 1: Make sure the Prompt component is connected to OpenAI component's Input and that System Message is kept empty:
![[Pasted image 20250211020722.png]]

And make sure the prompt template is:
```
{context}

---

Given the context above, answer the question as best as possible.

Question: {question}

Answer: 
```

Rationale for check 1:
There is no need for system message because the ChatGPT will take your prompt which has the AstraDB answer and your question, then reword it into a proper answer, as if ChatGPT was the one that did the querying into your RAG content.

CHECK 2:
Make sure Chat Input outbounds to Search Query as well as Prompt's "{question}" variable:

![[Pasted image 20250211021153.png]]

Rationale for check 2:
You are querying the AstraDB vector for answers, so the AstraDB needs to receive your question. Then AstraDB's answer data is extracted into the Prompt. You also concatenate the Prompt with your original question because your Prompt is asking ChatGPT to reword the prompt into a response as if ChatGPT was the one that looked up your AstraDB. Remember the prompt has both the answer already and the original question.

After all checks passed, proceed to ask the question.

Enter either at the Chat Input or the Playground (the playground knows which flow to use BECAUSE there's only one Chat Input and it's connected to the Retrieval flow):
```
The Knights originally consisted of how many brethen?
```

So you've entered:
![[Pasted image 20250211021618.png]]

Then run the Retrieval flow (by clicking play on the farthest right component, which is the Chat Output), or wait for Playground to finish running the flow.

If in canvas, you'll get this:
![[Pasted image 20250211021717.png]]

If in Playground, you'll get this:
![[Pasted image 20250211021743.png]]

When you open the text, you'll find the Knight Templars originally had nine members and discusses who the unknown ninth member may be:

**Congratulations, you've successfully performed RAG!**


---

**And if you had asked an unrelated question**

If you had asked "How tall is Mt Everest" instead of asking about Knight Templars, then the AI's response would've been: "The text does not provide information on the height of Mt Everest."

This works because your prompt under the hood had instructed ChatGPT to reword the relevant answer (aka variable `{context}`) into replying to your question (variable `{question}`).

If you want to allow the user to ask about Knight Templars OR about Mt Everest, then your Prompt component (to ChatGPT model component) would have the template:
```
{context}

---

Given the context above, answer the question as best as possible.

But... the user is also allowed to ask about Mt Everest

Question: {question}

Answer: 
```
