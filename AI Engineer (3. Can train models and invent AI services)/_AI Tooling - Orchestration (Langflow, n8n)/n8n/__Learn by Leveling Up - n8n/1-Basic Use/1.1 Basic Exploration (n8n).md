Basic exploring. Let's checkout Overview

Let's create a new Workflow. Click "Create Workflow" at the top right. Name the workflow however you'd like. I'm naming it "My workflow - Lessons"

---

Terminology:

- As you can see from clicking the button or the URL, this whole canva is really a workflow:
  ![[Pasted image 20250607063851.png]]
- But you'll also see that inside this workflow canva can have multiple workflows. Sneak peak:

Let's add a scheduled trigger as the beginning node.

A node called "Schedule Trigger" appears
![[Pasted image 20250606231559.png]]


If you double click into the Schedule Trigger, you can set the time. We can leave it at midnight. 
![[Pasted image 20250607063249.png]]

^ Since our workflow is off, we don't really care about it actually running at midnight daily (see top right for a gray Inactive switch):
![[Pasted image 20250607064222.png]]

^ Another important point is the description inside the Schedule Trigger reads: "This workflow will run on the schedule you define..". This means the trigger node is the start of an entire workflow. So therefore you can have multiple workflows on the same canvas, despite the canvas also being called a workflow. To make things less confusing, we will call the whole page a "canva" or "workflow canva", and what's on the canva are workflow(s).

The first node is the Trigger node. Without a trigger node, the workflow won't run. There are various types of trigger nodes:
- You open a list of Trigger node to start a new workflow on the canva (clicking Plus on the top right first):

Before we continue:
Know how to save!

Let's save now. Top right to click Save:

> [!note] Tip
> Save often. A common pitfall for beginners is not saving and then leaving the page, and then losing their work.

---

Expand beyond the Trigger Node.

Connect the node to a new node. You can either press the plus on the connection line or press the large plus at the top right of the canvas:
![[Pasted image 20250607064430.png]]

Let's add a Do nothing node that literally does nothing, because we don't want to jump too ahead of ourselves.

![[Pasted image 20250607064641.png]]

You don't need to adjust any settings for the Do Nothing node. It may have automatically kicked you into its settings. You can click out of it like it's a modal when you click anywhere in the backdrop. Or you can click "Back to canvas" at the top left:
![[Pasted image 20250607064838.png]]

If the two nodes are not connected, try connecting them. It's a matter of drag and dropping the outgoing line to an inlet. You should have:
![[Pasted image 20250607064743.png]]

---

Now I challenge you to select both nodes by drag and dropping a box, then performing CMD+C (Or Ctrl+C) then pasting (CMD+V or Ctrl+V). Your result should be a duplicated workflow in the canva:

1...
![[Pasted image 20250607065157.png]]

2... I box selected the duplicated workflow, then dragged them to be underneath the original workflow:
![[Pasted image 20250607065028.png]]


Btw, CMD+X for cutting works too, working more like disconnecting then pasting back.

Let's go a bit more advanced. Open a text editor or VS Code and paste there with a CMD+V or CMD+V. You'll see JSON pasted:
![[Pasted image 20250607065238.png]]

In actuality, what's happening when you CMD+C on the nodes is that the JSON is copying to your clipboard. When you CMD+V into the canva, the JSON is intercepted and rendered into nodes and connections.

Let's take that further. At the top right, you can import json:
![[Pasted image 20250607065341.png]]

The implications is that you can share workflows with other people by copying your canva nodes into a code or text editor, then saving the file as JSON file. You can also make a backup of your workflow in json format. You'll be able to re-import the nodes and relationships from a JSON file.

Another implication is that it's easy for people to share JSON with the community.
- Open the "Do Nothing" node
- Click Docs next to the tabs:
  ![[Pasted image 20250607065532.png]]
- It will open https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.noop and it has community contributed "templates" there that usually involves this type of node:
  ![[Pasted image 20250607065708.png]]

You can also view templates from "verified creators" at:
https://n8n.io/creators/

Use cases have templates as well:
![[Pasted image 20250607065833.png]]

A template usually looks like an embed you can browse at the convenience of your own web browser:
![[Pasted image 20250607065901.png]]

Notice there's a "Copy workflow" button. You can after clicking that button, paste into your canva. Web browsers can indeed easily copy text including json to your clipboard.
