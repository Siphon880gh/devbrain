Global variables that are accessible by all workflows in the Project are only available on paid plans (Pro or higher).Â

## Workflow variables?

These global variables cannot be edited by the workflow. So a workaround is to set the environmental variables and that can be your global variables ([[1.3 Environmental Variables]]), or you can create variables manually in a Code node at the same branch and it'll pipe the input of variables into a node that will disregard or ignore that input. So that in a future node, you can click Input panel's dropdown to select a previous node's input. While there is no official word for this, I call it workflow variables

See this workflow:

We will imitate the logic of when you first setup a wordpress website, it asks for your database connection details and also asks if you want to add a database prefix like wp_ (which allows your MySQL databases to list wordpress databases all in one place near the bottom where database names starting with 'w' starts)

Code: Set Database Prefix:
```
return {  
  prefix: "wp_"  
}
```

Code: Mock Databases
```
[  
  {  
    "wengs_homepage": {  
      "wp_posts": [  
        1,  
        2,  
        3,  
        4  
      ],  
      "wp_users": [  
        "weng",  
        "wayne"  
      ]  
    }  
  },  
  {  
    "daves_mechanic_shop": {  
      "wp_posts": [  
        1,  
        2  
      ],  
      "wp_users": [  
        "dave"  
      ]  
    }  
  }  
]
```

"Rename Keys" node:
- Current Key Name:
```
{{ $json.keys().first() }}
```

- New Key Name:
	```
	{{ $('Code: Database Prefix (Optional Setting in Wordpress)').item.json.prefix }}{{ $json.keys()[0] }}
	```
- Follows `$(" NODE_NAME ").item.json.KEY_NAME`

Looks like:
