**Situation**: 

Every week, you need a report on your salespersons' performance. n8n can be used to get the current week's dataset because each salesperson record has the date they closed their sale.

In addition, the salesperson record has the saleperson's name, region, the amount of money they pulled in, and the date they closed the sale.

---

This tutorial will be broken down over a series of subsequent lessons. You will learn in this lesson:
- Learn to get today's date
	- Learn the executive context of all previous nodes' outputs that you have access to at a later node
- Learn to calculate the difference in days from today's date and the date saved in a record
	- Learn to save the date difference into each salesperson record (the default will save the date difference and discard the original record)

---

Create this workflow (do not worry about correct settings):

At "Date & Time: Today" node:
- Enter the date `6/10/25`. This is because we have sales that are closed on this date and earlier
- Make sure Output Field Name is set to `today`. That will be the field we pull from in order to perform date difference calculations later:

At "Mock Data Sales"
- In the real world, you'd actually "Get Data Sales" from Hubspot, etc. But we are learning right now.
- Let's mock the data by adding this to Javascript, running once for all items:
```
// Generate mock sales data for the exercise
return [
  { "salesperson": "Alice", "region": "West", "amount": 500, "date": "2025-06-08" },
  { "salesperson": "Bob", "region": "East", "amount": 300, "date": "2025-06-05" },
  { "salesperson": "Alice", "region": "West", "amount": 200, "date": "2025-06-02" },
  { "salesperson": "Bob", "region": "East", "amount": 400, "date": "2025-05-30" },
  { "salesperson": "Charlie", "region": "North", "amount": 750, "date": "2025-06-09" },
  { "salesperson": "Diana", "region": "South", "amount": 320, "date": "2025-06-07" },
  { "salesperson": "Alice", "region": "West", "amount": 180, "date": "2025-06-06" },
  { "salesperson": "Charlie", "region": "North", "amount": 890, "date": "2025-06-04" },
  { "salesperson": "Diana", "region": "South", "amount": 220, "date": "2025-05-28" },
  { "salesperson": "Bob", "region": "East", "amount": 600, "date": "2025-06-10" }
];
```

Notice that each sales record has a date they closed the sale. It also has an amount of how much the salesperson was able to pull in.

Also notice that because the getting date node is ran before the mock sales node, we are essentially discarding the generated Today's date from the output at this point on:
![[Pasted image 20250611025743.png]]

But don't worry! Because the Today node was ran in the same branch, it is in the same executive context - you'll be able to pull in the today's field at a later node that will calculate the time difference between today and each sales closed date.

>[!note] Discussion about execution context
> Had you done the workflow like this so that the Date &Time Diff can get each sale item's closing date AS WELL AS today's date, so you can calculate the difference. It would fail:
> ![[Pasted image 20250611030111.png]]
> 
> Even though when you speak it out, it makes sense: Im giving today's date and the individual item's sales date, so I can get the difference in days. However, as you can see at the bottom right, it won't recognize the field "today" that you will reference in the Diff calculation later. This is because the "Date & Time: Today" is in another branch, and therefore is outside of the executive context and unaccessible
>
> But by placing the Today data within the same branch, although Mock Sales Data appeared to not have piped the today field through, then it becomes accessible via executive context. This is correct:

> And to further illustrate this point, when you click the dropdown in the Input panel at the Date Difference node, you see it actually has access to the inputs several nodes back, as long as they're in the same branch.

So far what we covered are:
![[Pasted image 20250611030550.png]]

And for the rest of the tutorial, we will loop over each item, meaning each sales object will be run in this circuit. The circuit will run 10 times, each time comparing the object's sales date with today's date to get a difference in days:
![[Pasted image 20250611025349.png]]

At "Loop Over Items", make sure it's batching by 1 item at a time:
![[Pasted image 20250611030839.png]]

---

At "Date &Time: Diff" node:
- Set the start date to the sales date (because it's the older date)
- Set the end date to the Todays date calculated at an earlier node.
- Notice you have access to the previous node and all nodes coming before it 
  ![[Pasted image 20250611031042.png]]
- You can manually type in the variables OR you can go into recent or older input, and then drag and drop the field from Input panel into the Parameters fields:

> [!note] Discussion: Debugging Loop node's iteration output or finished output
>When you double click into the date diff node, and then you execute the step - It will give you the output for 1 item:
>![[Pasted image 20250611031300.png]]
> 
>No matter how many times you press it, likely it'll show the same output (Alice). This is because conceptually, you have clicked inside the Loop node of a current iteration.
>- Only the first item (Alice)

>But if you had clicked "Execute workflow" at the bottom of the canvas, THEN double click into the Loop node, you'll see all items:
