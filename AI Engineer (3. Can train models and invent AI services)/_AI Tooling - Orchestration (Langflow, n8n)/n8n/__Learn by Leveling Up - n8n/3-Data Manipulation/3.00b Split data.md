Template: Used n8n's Essay Scraper at https://n8n.io/workflows/1951-scrape-and-summarize-webpages-with-ai

When you load data from a scraper, API, or similar source, it often comes in as an array—for example, an array of essay titles.

In this case, it's just a list of strings. But to work with each title individually in your n8n workflow, you need each string to be wrapped as an object. That’s because n8n expects an array of **objects** at the top level—each object is treated as one input item.

This data structure allows n8n to process each item separately, such as:
* Looping through each input
* Sending each one to an AI prompt
* Limiting the workflow to only the first few items

To convert a simple array (like strings) into individual objects, you use the **Loop Over Items (Split in Batches)** node or the **Split Out** node, depending on the context). It turns each primitive value into its own object, making it compatible with n8n's workflow logic.

The "Extract essay names" node extracted from HTML tables into an array of essay title strings. Using Limit or Http Request nodes (Here: "Fetch essay tests") wouldn't have worked without changing the array elements into inputs, which are recognized units of logic for n8n.
