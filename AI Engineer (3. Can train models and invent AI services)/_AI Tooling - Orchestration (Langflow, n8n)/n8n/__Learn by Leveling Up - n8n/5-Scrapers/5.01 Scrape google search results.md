Sign up for SERP API at [https://serpapi.com/pricing](https://serpapi.com/pricing)  

You will create a SerpAPI node that relies on the API key you get from signing up at SerpAPI

This service is not entirely free. Free accounts get 100 searches a month. Higher paid tiers get drastically more searches per month: https://serpapi.com/pricing

You'll need to signup and verify both email and phone number. If you don't trust the company, you can use a temporarily Google Voice number. You can keep this number forever as long as you keep it active (call/text 3 months at a time)
