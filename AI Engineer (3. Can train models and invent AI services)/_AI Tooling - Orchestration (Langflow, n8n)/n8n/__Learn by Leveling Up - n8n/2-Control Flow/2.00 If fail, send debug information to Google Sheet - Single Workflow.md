We will create a testing scenario where we expect a value to be equal to 1, but the actual value is 2, so it equates to false. The if node then sends the false to debughelper which will log a helpful error message to Google Sheets. This simulates a failed automated test not only throwing but also logging to a google sheet.

Please create this workflow (your settings dont need to be correct yet):

At Code node:
- Run once for all items, Javascript
```
return {  
  expectedVal: 1,  
  actualVal: 2  
}
```

---

At If node:

- It's truthy if the actual value passes the test. It's falsy if the actual value does not match the expected value.
- Drag and drop the fields from the left "Input" panel into the Condition fields
- Or you could manually type in `{{$json.expectedVal}}`  and `{{$json.actualVal}}` . The `$json` represents the current input.

At DebugHelper

- Falsy or failed test should go to DebugHelper which can help enrich messages into an error message.
- The default error message field can have a message like "Node has thrown an error" which is too generic of an error. We're going to code in expressions into the error message.
- As you type in code or expressions inside of `{{.. }}`, get used to momentarily pausing in the middle of typing to bring up Autocomplete suggestions, their descriptions, and example code snippets. This can be helpful as you're still learning the n8n coding.

- Have the DebugHelper not only give a generic error message but enrich it with the entire input by having `{{$input.all().toJsonString()}}` .
- Notice in the Result Preview (gray text underneath the Error Message) and the Output (after you clicked "Execute step") that the enriched data includes a "pairItem" property that helps with debugging.

When you add Google Sheet, select append

Let's test the workflow. Since Google Sheet node is the final node, when we hit execute, it'll run the entire workflow. We can also take advantage of seeing what data is supposedly sent to Google Sheet. I do suggest splitting the screen into n8n and the actual Google Sheet so we can see if the spreadsheet successfully updates.

^If your spreadsheet already has headers in the first row, but they don’t match the field names in your input (like `expectedValue` and `actualValue`), it might look like nothing was added. In reality, the data may have been appended far to the right—Google Sheets will place unmatched fields in new columns instead of under existing headers. Just scroll to the right to find them.

If this works, that's great! Let's discuss the workflow that we currently have and a way to improve it.

Referring back to the workflow:

You notice we haven't connected the True connector. This is intentional. Let's say this is an automated test before the rest of your workflow. Then the true connector will be where you connect to the rest of the workflow.
