Requirement: Performed the work at [[2.00 If fail, send debug information to Google Sheet - Single Workflow]]

Let's review the workflow we have so far that actually works and can send a test fail as an error log to Google Sheet:

This approach doesn’t scale well in large workflows where you might want to throw errors and log them centrally. Duplicating `DebugHelper` and `Google Sheet` nodes across the workflow would create unnecessary clutter and slow down the n8n developer.

Take a look at this workflow canva:

Or even better, speaking of making things easier on the n8n developer:
- Create a sticky note by right clicking an empty area on the canva, then resizing up the note, changing the background color, and inputting explanations:

Now you can send any errors to this sub-workflow on the same canvas.

## How to setup?

It's not as intuitive as it seems. There are two types of Execute Workflow nodes:

1..

2..

^ ✋ Blink and you'll miss it. The second type of execute workflow node is hidden under the collapsed section Triggers. Make sure to expand it.

The two execute workflow node types are (based on the section headings):
- Action
- Trigger

Referring back to the workflow canva:

The main workflow is connected to the Action type. In the real world, you likely will have multiple Action nodes across your workflow in order to log to Google Sheet whenever there is an error.

The subworkflow that you expect to trigger whenever the action node gets run - that's the Trigger type. The Trigger Workflow starts the subworkflow.


**There are some important settings you have to consider:**
- At the Action node ("Execute Workflow") make sure it triggers the current canva (since the subworkflow) is here

- At the Trigger node that starts the subworkflow, make sure it's set to pipe in all inputs:

Other concerns
- Notice the Execute Workflow action node does not offer an option on which workflow on the canva to run? Technically, it will execute all subworkflows that start from an Execute Workflow trigger node, because you're only allowed one subworkflow that is an Execute Workflow Trigger. If you try to add more execute workflow triggers, you'll get an error that you're limited to only one per workflow:

- If you need different subworkflow executions throughout your main workflow, simply create the subworkflows in other canvas.
- Where to click to play the nodes through. We had been clicking play on the final node. With this canva, that may be awkward. Let's just hit the "Execute workflow" button at the bottom:
  ![[Pasted image 20250610230442.png]]
- Does it reveal that the error logger has been ran through?
  No it doesn't. Unlike the normal workflows that have checkmarks in their nodes after being ran through, the subworkflow using an execute workflow trigger DOES NOT show checkmarks. Here is how the screen looks like after an error log (that I confirmed on the actual Google Sheet):
  ![[Pasted image 20250610230604.png]]
- ^ That design is intentionally because the subworkflow doesn't always run after the main workflow, and it could be ran multiple times if you have multiple action nodes pointing to here or the action node is inside a looping branch.
- You can confirm errors logged to Google Sheet by checking the actual Google Sheet or switching into Executions log mode (rather than Editor):
