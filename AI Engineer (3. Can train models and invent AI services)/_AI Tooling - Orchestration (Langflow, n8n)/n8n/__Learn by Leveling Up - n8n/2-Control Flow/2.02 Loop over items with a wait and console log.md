We will loop over an array of mocked objects. By having mocked objects, it can loop over each object, 1 second at a time. To be able to visualize this happening in real time, we will console log the current UTC time every time we iterate to a new object.

Create this workflow (No need to have correct settings for now):
- You may need help creating a node inside the loop over items branch. Hints are at [[Looping - n8n]]

The goal is that when we hit "Execute workflow" at the bottom:

We will see in Chrome DevTools console (CMD+OPT+J) that a console log runs every second:

Why are we doing this?
- To learn n8n concepts like mocking data, looping over arrays, using `console.log()` for debugging (especially useful in `n8n` Code nodes), and adding wait/sleep delays.
- More importantly, this pattern is critical when working with APIs. If you’re sending requests for multiple items, introducing a delay helps prevent overwhelming the API—especially for rate-limited or fragile endpoints

At "Code: Mock Data"
```
return [
  {
    a:1
  },
  {
    a:2
  },
  {
    a:3
  }
]
```

---
At "Loop Over Items" node, make sure it's batching by 1 item at a time:

At "Code: Console Log Timestamp"
```
// console.log($input.item.json, " at ", (new Date).toTimeString())
console.log($json, " at ", (new Date).toTimeString())

return $input.item
```

At "Wait: 1 second":
- Change the wait to 1 second:

CHECKPOINT: 
- The [{a:1}, {a:2}, {a:3}] are treated as separate inputs (for example, multiple users completed surveys, and those surveys are saved into queue for n8n to process - then each survey is an object in this array - and each object in the array is considered an input)
- When you look at the connections carefully, you see in gray text above the connector line how many items are inputted or outputted:
  ![[Pasted image 20250611012158.png]]
	- The Scheduler Trigger outputs a cron job object in case you need its properties for your node or scripts down the flowchart.
	- At the "Code: Mock Data", we overrode the default code that comes with it, which usually just pipes over the input to the output. We instead returned our own custom array of objects. Notice our custom array is an object of properties a:Number
	- Then "Code: Mock Data" outputs 3 items, as if users had completed one-answer surveys that asked them to assign a number to the question labeled "a".
	- At the Looping branch, each item is actually piped through the "Loop" branch. The "Done" branch runs only after the "Loop" branches are run for as many iterations as there are inputs. When the workflow is not running, it may not be clear that it's actually 1 item being piped in for 3 times. It seems to follow the same convention of how many items are piped in and piped out as if it's any other node
	  ![[Pasted image 20250611012503.png]]
		- However, if you actually run the workflow, you'll watch that they became 1 item labels, then 2 item labels, then 3 items label, especially with a Wait node (otherwise it goes too fast for you to notice the number incrementing):
