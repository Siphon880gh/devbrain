Requirement: Finished [[4.02 Adding 1]]

Let's continue from the Edit Field section. We add a new Code node after the Workflow Trigger. We can call this Code node "Code: Formulas"
![[Pasted image 20250617053645.png]]

We will essentially use that node like for workflow variables as discussed in [[4.01 Global variables and workflow variables]]

Instead of storing raw data like we usually do (string, number, etc), we will store expressions aka formulas:
```
return {
  formulas: {
    indexPlusOne: "{{ $json.a + 1 }}"
  }
}
```

So inside that node looks like:

Then change "Edit Field" node to the following:

If instead of "Edit Fields" node, you use a "Code" node like the first approach at [[4.02 Adding 1]], then the Code node will look like when double clicked into it:
![[Pasted image 20250617053957.png]]

That code `$evaluateExpression( $('Code: Formulas').first().json.formulas.indexPlusOne) )` evaluates the stored expression that is `{{ json.a + 1 }}`

Hot tip: If you renamed your workflow variables "Code" node to "Vars", then you can still communicate the intention of that node but also keep code that references variables much shorter, to:
```
`$evaluateExpression( $('Vars').first().json.formulas.indexPlusOne) )`
```
