As you can see from prior lessons, n8n has special variables to access the current input's data (`$json.YOUR_FIELD_NAME`)

There are other special variables. Let's simplify how we advanced indexes in [[4.03 Adding 1 with an expression - Aka formula, evaluateExpression]]. We'll continue off from the "Edit Fields (Set)" node

Let's look at itemIndex:
`{{ $itemIndex + 1 }}`

Works great!

Not to be confused with `$runIndex`

And not to be confused with `$inputIndex` which DOES NOT exist.
