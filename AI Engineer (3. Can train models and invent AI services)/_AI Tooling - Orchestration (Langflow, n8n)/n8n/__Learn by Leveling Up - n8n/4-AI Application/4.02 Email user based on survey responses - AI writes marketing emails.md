Requirement: You must have enabled OpenAI API (https://platform.openai.com) with a payment method. The estimated cost of using AI for this tutorial is less than a cent.  This is a separate product from the $20/month ChatGPT.

Recall that the goal is:
I have an imaginary product and fake survey data on who expressed interest in new features. And had AI generate emails based on their interest level

We have enough data to generate emails that are based off user's interest level from the previous tutorial.

This tutorial will CONTINUE from the previous lesson that stopped before adding the AI nodes.

You'll learn:
- Slicing
- Prompting AI Agent with previous input to produce structured defined output

We would like to leverage AI to craft an offer letter based on interest level. However, with 10 items for testing purposes, that's a bit much although it still costs less than a penny. It's always a good practice to limit the number of AI requests during early phase of the development. 

Instead of sending 10 users, we can send 5 users to AI to generate 5 email messages

You could've achieved this by adding slicing into the Code node below the interestLevel randomizer:
- ðŸ›‘ But don't do that!
```
// Loop over input items and mock a fake interest level  
for (const item of $input.all()) {  
  item.json.interestLevel = (Math.ceil(Math.random()*3)-1); // 0-3 interest level  
}  

// Slice array to 5 objects
const inputs = $input.all().slice(0,5);  
  
return inputs;
```

What you should do instead is a Limit node. This makes the intention clear to other n8n team members (and yourself if you come back to it after a long hiatus).

Let's add a Limit node and set the limit to 5:
![[Pasted image 20250610073111.png]]

Notice that the gray text on the left panel was 10 items coming in and the gray text on the right panel was 5 items outputted. This is what we expect:
- Click **Execute Step** until you have all interest levels 0, 1, 2, and 3, in the output. We want to make sure the AI is fully capable of generating an email message based on the interest level.
![[Pasted image 20250610074356.png]]

Also notice that the nodes are named clearly, explaining our intention each step along the way:
![[Pasted image 20250610074438.png]]

Now let's add the AI Agent node. If it opens the AI Agent settings right away, just close it out back to the Workflow.

Back at canva:
![[Pasted image 20250610025819.png]]

^ See that Chat Model is absolutely required (red asterisk). Click it and select your chat model:
![[Pasted image 20250610025830.png]]

At OpenAI dashboard, get an API key and have billing linked. If you need help with navigating their OpenAI dashboard to get to the API key, refer to codernotes.wengindustries.com/?open=Get%20API%20Keys%20-%20OpenAI%20Platform

![[Pasted image 20250610030036.png]]

On completion of the chat model engine, back to the workflow, the AI node now looks like:
![[Pasted image 20250610030046.png]]

Lets open the AI Agent now.

Make sure for source for prompt to change it to "define below"
![[Pasted image 20250610030055.png]]

Test this prompt:
```
Just repeat back to me:  
{{$input.all().toJsonString()}}
```


Notice it glitchingly repeats the answer three times though
![[Pasted image 20250610030120.png]]

We will fix the three times repeating glitch at a later time, but we can see that the AI agent sorta understands us. Now let's add the real prompt:
```
For each object in the provided json, generate a personalized offer letter based on the user's interest level from the product feature survey, which is in the provided json as the key "interestLevel"  
  
You will output a structured json. That letter should be in the field "personalizedLetter". I will describe the schema of the output structured json.  
  
Interest Level 0 (Not Interested):  
Greet the user by their name and thank them for participating in the survey. No further action or information is needed.  
  
Interest Level 1 (Somewhat Interested):  
Greet the user by their name and thank them for completing the survey. Let them know they can follow product updates on our blog. Mention that weâ€™ll notify them if the new feature is officially released.  
  
Interest Level 2 (Very Interested):  
Greet the user by their name and thank them for completing the survey. Let them know theyâ€™ll receive early access to the feature during its beta release. Include a note that they can opt out if they prefer not to participate.  
  
Our blog link is domain.com/blog and they can reply back NO if they dont want to participate.  
  
The output structured json's schema is described as:  
"""  
[  
  {  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ"name": Name of the user,  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ"email": email of the user,  
    â€ƒ"personalizedLetter": "Dear {{Name}}...",  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ"interestLevel": the interest level number  
  }  
]  
"""  
  
Provided json:  
{{$input.all().toJsonString()}}
```

Enable "Require Specific Output Format", then click the red "output parser" link
![[Pasted image 20250610030242.png]]

You click "output parser" at:
![[Pasted image 20250610030252.png]]

You will be kicked back out to the workflow canva and be presented options to select a Parser at the right side panel:
![[Pasted image 20250610030447.png]]

Select Structured Output Parser:
![[Pasted image 20250610030501.png]]

Add JSON example (use semantic values.. dont need to be actual values):
```
[  
  {  
    "name": "Name",  
    "email": "email@email.com",  
    "personalizedLetter": "Dear....",  
    "interestLevel": 0  
  }  
]
```

Will automatically add a "Parser" outlet to the AI Agent and connect to your new Output Parser:
![[Pasted image 20250610030654.png]]

Open into AI Agent and Execute step because we expect it will output correctly:
- But still, notice it glitchtly outputs 3 items of the repeating answers:
  ![[Pasted image 20250610030713.png]]
  
  But notice the letter generated is based on the user's interest level in new updates:
  ![[Pasted image 20250610030728.png]]

---


Let's fix the 3 outputs by having the provided json be the json object, NOT the entire array of json objects:
```
{{$json.toJsonString()}}
```

So what we had is NOT good `{{$input.all().toJsonString()}}`

Now it's correct number of outputs:
