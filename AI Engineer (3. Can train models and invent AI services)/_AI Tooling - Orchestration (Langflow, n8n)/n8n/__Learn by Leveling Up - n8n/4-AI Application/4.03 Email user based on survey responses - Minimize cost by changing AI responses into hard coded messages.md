Get the email messages that the AI bot generated for interest levels 0, 1, 2, 3. You may have to re-play the nodes in order to cover all interest levels.

Then swap out the AI bot. 

Instead of:
![[Pasted image 20250610075229.png]]

We will have:
![[Pasted image 20250610075317.png]]

In place of the AI Agent, add a node called "Switch":
![[Pasted image 20250610075340.png]]

You're inside Switch node settings. Click "Add Routing Rule". Drag the field interestLevel from any object (n8n will understand you meant any iteration's interestLevel), and drag it into the expression field.

Then match it to the value 0. Make sure the data type is a number. The above screenshot has the datatype to a string, which is the default choice when you just added a new routing rule.

Now add the routing rules for all possible interestLevels: 0,1,2,3. And then execute:
![[Pasted image 20250610080126.png]]

From the above you can see that there are two users with 0 interest and three users with a little interest (interest level at 1). By chance alone out of 5 random interestLevel's, there were no interestLevel 2 and 3

Your workflow now looks like this:

We would then copy down all the AI generated email messages from interest levels 0 to 3. Then we hard code the messages into these switch routes. The goal is to minimize using OpenAI credits for such trivial tasks of writing email letters based on someone's reported interest level for future features. 

In the real world, that approach...

> [!note] In the real world, that approach...
> cuts costs at scale by avoiding OpenAI credits, but it also means your emails will start to look identicalâ€”something Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and other providers flag as spam. The usual fix is to route every hard-coded template through an HTTP request that hits a self-hosted, free AI model. The model rewrites each message on the fly. These free AI models are usually sufficient, especially since they're not generating text from scratch, but are instead rewriting your messages. By adding enough variation, you can keep your email deliverability high.


After outputting the message based on the user's interest level, we pass that straight into the Send Email node.

Your final workflow could look like this:
![[Pasted image 20250610082820.png]]

As for the "Create Message" Code node, your code likely will be:
![[Pasted image 20250610083410.png]]

The code is actually:
```
// Loop over input items with this same interest level
for (const item of $input.all()) {
  item.json.prepareEmail = {};
  item.json.prepareEmail.from = "admin@domain.com";
  item.json.prepareEmail.to = item.json.email;
  item.json.prepareEmail.subject = `Thanks for completing the survey`;
  item.json.prepareEmail.message = `Hi ${item.json.name},
  
  Thanks for having no interest what so ever in our app's feature features, but bothered to complete the survey. Just kidding with the tone! Please do check out our website domain.com every once in a while. Maybe something will catch your attention. In the mean time, we'll respect your wishes and won't promote new features to you.`;
}

return $input.all();
```

You would craft the email message for each "Create Message" Code node corresponding to the interest level. In the above code snippet, the user had chosen 0 interest rate, so therefore we mentioned respecting their wishes of not being bothered.

As for the "Send Email" node, that will be covered in the next lesson with a small workflow example. Let's not actually make this large workflow be able to email people, because the user data has fake email addresses.
