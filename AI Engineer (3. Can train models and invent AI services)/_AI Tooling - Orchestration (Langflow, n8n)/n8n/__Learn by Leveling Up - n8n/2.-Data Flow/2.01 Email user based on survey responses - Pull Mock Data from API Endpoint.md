Goal:
I have an imaginary product and fake survey data on who expressed interest in new features. And had AI generate emails based on their interest level

This tutorial will only cover up the steps to right before AI nodes. Next lesson will cover AI nodes

You'll learn to swap nodes for:
- Scheduling a workflow
- Fetching json from an url

In real world application, n8n would poll an API for new survey responses, and forward the data to an email module—whether an AI agent or a simple switch node. That module then sends tailored messages according to each responder’s interest level, from **0 = “No interest”** up to **3 = “Keep me in the loop.”** So let's replace the Manual trigger with a Schedule Trigger that runs everyday at midnight. Don't worry - it won't actually run because you haven't turned on the workflow at the top right. 

After swapping the Manual Trigger with a Schedule Trigger, your workflow looks like:

And in regards to pulling in the data from an API endpoint, let's practice that now. Where the Code Node is, let's swap it for "HTTP Request" node. We will make a GET request to 
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users. This endpoint returns an array of 10 user objects. JSON Placeholder is a free service so this will work right away.

As with all node, you get kicked into that node's settings right away when you create the node.

Set to GET to that API Endpoint and hit "Execute step". You should see 10 items in the response panel:

You'll land on the canva after closing http request settings:

Enrich into User Survey Responses:
Click **Play** on the final node to run the workflow end-to-end. Watch the item counts change: the **Schedule** node starts with a single object, the **HTTP Request** node pulls in 10 user records, and the **Code** node trims the list down to 3. The gray labels above each connection show these numbers in real time:

We are done with this tutorial. The next tutorial continues from this point because it will talk about adding an AI agent. We have enough data to generate emails that are based off user's interest level.
