Recall that the goal is:

I have an imaginary product and fake survey data on who expressed interest in new features. And had AI generate emails based on their interest level

We have enough data to generate emails that are based off user's interest level from the previous tutorial.

This tutorial will CONTINUE from the previous lesson that stopped before adding the AI nodes.

You'll learn:
- Prompting AI Agent with previous input to produce structured defined output

Add AI Model next. Let's have AI model craft an offer letter based on interest level. If it opens the AI Agent settings right away, just close it out back to the Workflow (because we need to also add the Chat Model that powers the AI Agent).

Back at canva:
![[Pasted image 20250610025819.png]]

See that Chat Model is absolutely required (red asterisk). Click it and select your chat model:
![[Pasted image 20250610025830.png]]

Requirement: have backend OpenAI account access (separate from the $20/month ChatGPT app)
[http://platform.openai.com/](http://platform.openai.com/)

At OpenAI dashboard, get an API key and have billing linked. If you need help with navigating their OpenAI dashboard to get to the API key, refer to codernotes.wengindustries.com/?open=Get%20API%20Keys%20-%20OpenAI%20Platform

On completion of the chat model engine, back to the workflow, it looks like:
![[Pasted image 20250610030046.png]]

Lets open the AI Agent now.

Make sure for source for prompt to change it to "define below"
![[Pasted image 20250610030055.png]]

Test this prompt:
```
Just repeat back to me:  
{{$input.all().toJsonString()}}
```


Notice it glitchingly repeats the answer three times though
![[Pasted image 20250610030120.png]]

We will fix the three times repeating glitch at a later time, but we can see that the AI agent sorta understands us. Now let's add the real prompt:
```
For each object in the provided json, generate a personalized offer letter based on the user's interest level from the product feature survey, which is in the provided json as the key "interestLevel"  
  
You will output a structured json. That letter should be in the field "personalizedLetter". I will describe the schema of the output structured json.  
  
Interest Level 0 (Not Interested):  
Greet the user by their name and thank them for participating in the survey. No further action or information is needed.  
  
Interest Level 1 (Somewhat Interested):  
Greet the user by their name and thank them for completing the survey. Let them know they can follow product updates on our blog. Mention that we’ll notify them if the new feature is officially released.  
  
Interest Level 2 (Very Interested):  
Greet the user by their name and thank them for completing the survey. Let them know they’ll receive early access to the feature during its beta release. Include a note that they can opt out if they prefer not to participate.  
  
Our blog link is domain.com/blog and they can reply back NO if they dont want to participate.  
  
The output structured json's schema is described as:  
"""  
[  
  {  
     "name": Name of the user,  
     "email": email of the user,  
     "personalizedLetter": "Dear {{Name}}...",  
     "interestLevel": the interest level number  
  }  
]  
"""  
  
Provided json:  
{{$input.all().toJsonString()}}
```

Enable "Require Specific Output Format", then click the red "output parser" link
![[Pasted image 20250610030242.png]]

You click "output parser" at:
![[Pasted image 20250610030252.png]]

You will be kicked back out to the workflow canva and be presented options to select a Parser at the right side panel:
![[Pasted image 20250610030447.png]]

Select Structured Output Parser:
![[Pasted image 20250610030501.png]]

Add JSON example (use semantic values.. dont need to be actual values):
```
[  
  {  
    "name": "Name",  
    "email": "email@email.com",  
    "personalizedLetter": "Dear....",  
    "interestLevel": 0  
  }  
]
```

Will automatically add a "Parser" outlet to the AI Agent and connect to your new Output Parser:
![[Pasted image 20250610030654.png]]

Open into AI Agent and Execute step because we expect it will output correctly:
- But still, notice it glitchtly outputs 3 items of the repeating answers:
  ![[Pasted image 20250610030713.png]]
  
  But notice the letter generated is based on the user's interest level in new updates:
  ![[Pasted image 20250610030728.png]]

---


Let's fix the 3 outputs by having the provided json be the json object, NOT the entire array of json objects:
```
{{$json.toJsonString()}}
```

So what we had is NOT good `{{$input.all().toJsonString()}}`

Now it's correct number of outputs:
