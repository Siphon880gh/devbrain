Got it. Here's a cleaner, more scannable version with tighter phrasing and better flow for easier reading:

## 🧩 What is **n8n**?

**n8n** is more than just a workflow tool. It’s:

> 🟢 Automation like **Zapier**  
> 🧠 AI logic like **LangChain**  
> 🕷️ Scraping with **community-built nodes**

It’s billed as "workflow automation"—but that barely scratches the surface.

---

## 🔁 Zapier-Style Integrations

- 500+ **drag-and-drop nodes**: Gmail, Slack, Airtable, Notion, Webhooks, Google Sheets, etc.
- **Triggers**: cron, webhooks, app events
- **Logic tools**: If/Else, Split, Merge, Wait
- **Built-in**: error handling, retries, branching

---

## 🧠 AI Workflows & Logic

- Supports **OpenAI**, **Hugging Face**, **Anthropic**, and **local LLMs**
- Build **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflows
- Add custom logic with `Code` nodes.

---

## 🔄 Example: Hybrid Workflow

> 🔔 Slack alert → ✏️ Summarize with OpenAI → 🔍 Query AstraDB → 📧 Send email → 🧠 Save to knowledge base

✅ **Yes, it can RAG**  
✅ **Yes, it can tag with AstraDB**
