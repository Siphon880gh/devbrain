Let's say we want to copy the entire input (this also works at the output panel):

If this is an array you want to copy, make sure the line highlight is on the start of the array (In this case `[`). Likewise, if you're copying an object, make sure the line height is on the start of the object (`{`).

Move mouse to the top right corner of the inner panel (for inputs or outputs). In other words, move the mouse to the first line to the very right inside the panel. This is regardless if you're copying a later object:

^The copy icon appears when the mouse is over its area. Click to open -> Copy Selection. Although it's not your entire text selected, it's the starting array of object's line that's selected that Copy Selection looks into.
