### ⚠️ Using n8n on Heroku with Community Nodes? Here’s What You Need to Know

This applies to you if:

- You're running **n8n on Heroku**, including in a **Docker container**
- You access your instance via the Heroku app URL (to receive webhooks or edit workflows)
- You’ve installed **community nodes**
- You frequently see an **"Unrecognized node type"** error in your workflows, often daily when you log back into n8n to manage your workflows.

If so, read on—your setup is likely running into Heroku platform limitations.

---

### ❌ Why Community Nodes Keep Disappearing

Heroku uses an **ephemeral filesystem**, which resets on every:
- Dyno restart
- Deploy
- Idle timeout (common on free/eco plans)

When this happens, any installed **community nodes are wiped**, causing n8n to show “Unrecognized node type” errors. You can temporarily fix this by going to **Settings > Community Nodes** and reinstalling the node by name—but the problem will return after the next restart.

This makes Heroku unsuitable for persistent use of community nodes in n8n.

### 🪣 What About S3 Hero Dev?

Heroku provides an add-on called **S3 Hero Dev**, which:
- Gives you access to an Amazon S3 bucket
- Exposes credentials as environment variables
- Lets your app read/write objects from S3

✅ This is useful for storing files or logs from your workflows.  
❌ **But it does _not_ solve the issue of missing community nodes**, because it does **not allow Docker containers to mount S3 as a local filesystem**.

---

### 🔒 Why You Can’t Mount S3 on Heroku with Docker

You may have seen tools like:
- [`s3fs`](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse)
- [`goofys`](https://github.com/kahing/goofys)

These can mount an S3 bucket as a local directory—**but they rely on FUSE**.

#### 🚫 FUSE Isn’t Supported on Heroku

FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) allows userspace programs to implement a fully functional file system—but it requires:
- Elevated privileges
- Kernel module support

**Heroku does not support either**, even inside Docker builds. That means:
- You can’t use `s3fs`, `goofys`, or similar tools
- Even modifying your Dockerfile to install these tools and launching with a `.sh` script won’t work
- You **cannot mount** S3 into the container like a volume

In short: **Heroku is not compatible with FUSE-based mounting**, so there's no way to make community node installs persist through this method.

### 🛠️ Can't Leave Heroku? A Workaround if Speed Not an Issue

If you're not ready to move off Heroku, there's a partial workaround using:
#### `N8N_REINSTALL_MISSING_PACKAGES=true`

This environment variable tells n8n to reinstall missing community nodes automatically when it starts.

However, there's a catch:
- **Container restarts take time**, and the n8n server may not be immediately available
- You’ll likely need a **startup script or external monitor** that:
    1. Pings the Heroku URL every few minutes
    2. Waits until the app becomes reachable (i.e., not 503 or down)
    3. Triggers a health check or webhook call once n8n is fully ready
    4. If your app relies on n8n, consider showing a loading screen, loading sprite, or loading message to the user until a successful connection to n8n. Community nodes usually reinstall quickly, so the delay is minimal.

Note: This issue is most common on **eco or free plans**, which automatically shut down dynos after 30 minutes of inactivity. When the dyno restarts, the community nodes are lost due to Heroku’s **ephemeral filesystem**. Upgrading to a higher plan that avoids automatic shutdowns can help reduce these interruptions, but won’t fully solve the persistence issue.

### ✅ Real Alternatives: Use a Platform with Persistent Volumes

To run n8n with community nodes reliably, move to a platform that supports persistent storage:

| Platform              | Persistent Storage | Notes                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **VPS/Dedicated**     | ✅ Yes             | Full control, great for custom setups |
| **AWS ECS/Lightsail** | ✅ Yes             | Scalable, ideal for production use    |
| **Fly.io**            | ✅ Yes             | Lightweight, supports volumes         |
| **Render.com**        | ✅ Yes             | Docker support + persistent disk      |
| **Railway.app**       | ✅ Yes             | Simple deployment, supports volumes   |

These platforms let your container retain installed nodes and other local changes even after restarts or redeploys.

### 🔁 Summary

If you're using Heroku to host n8n with community nodes:
- You’ll run into issues with missing nodes due to Heroku’s **ephemeral filesystem**
- **S3 Hero Dev** can help with file storage, but **can’t be used to persist node installations**
- You **can’t mount S3** using FUSE-based tools like `s3fs` or `goofys`, because Heroku lacks FUSE support
- The best fix is to migrate to a platform that supports **persistent storage**.
