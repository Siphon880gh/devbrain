Yes, **you can absolutely add embeddings and connect to a vector database** in n8n â€” it just requires some manual setup using nodes like HTTP Request, Code, or Community Nodes.

### âœ… Here's how to add embeddings + vector database to your n8n workflow:


For AstraDB, refer to [[n8n Rag - AstraDB]]

For PineCone, refer to [[n8n Rag - Pinecone]]

#### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Use Results in AI Agent

Pipe the results from the vector DB into:

- Prompt context
- Memory field
- Or pass to another tool node

### ðŸ§  Bonus: Tools to Help

- [Langchain community node for n8n](https://n8n.io/integrations/langchain) (can wrap vector stores and memory)
- Use `Code` node to transform JSON and orchestrate multi-step logic
- Combine with `ChatGPT`, `Loop`, and `Wait` nodes for full retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

---

### TL;DR

Yes â€” you can:

- Generate embeddings (e.g., via OpenAI or Hugging Face)
- Store them in vector DBs (Pinecone, FAISS, etc.)
- Query based on new input
- Pipe results back into the AI Agent
