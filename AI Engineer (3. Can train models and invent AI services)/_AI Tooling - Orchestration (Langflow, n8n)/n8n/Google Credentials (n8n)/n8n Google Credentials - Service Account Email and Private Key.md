You can get the service account email at the Credentials page on Google Cloud Console under your service account.

To get the Private key, you create a public/private key at the service account's settings at Google Cloud Console. It will download a JSON file to your computer. Open the JSON file then copy the value at the key "private_key"

If you don't know the basics of adding OAuth2 at Google Cloud Console, refer to [[Credentials - Add Service Account]]
