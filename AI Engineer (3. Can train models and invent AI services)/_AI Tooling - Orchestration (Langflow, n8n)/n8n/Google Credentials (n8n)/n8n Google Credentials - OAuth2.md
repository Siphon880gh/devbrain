At Google Cloud Console:

Setup a new OAuth2 credential at your project's app at Google Cloud Console.

Make sure to paste the `OAuth Redirect URL` from **n8n Google Credentials** settings into the OAuth2 credential at Google Cloud Console.

Copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from the OAuth2 credential at Google Cloud Console for later.

If you don't know the basics of adding OAuth2 at Google Cloud Console, refer to [[Credentials - Add OAuth2]]

Then add to the Google Credential details to the **n8n Google Credential** settings:
