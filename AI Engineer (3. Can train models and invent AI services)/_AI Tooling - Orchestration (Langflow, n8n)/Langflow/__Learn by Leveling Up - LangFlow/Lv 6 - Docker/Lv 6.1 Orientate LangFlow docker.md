This is orientation only.

Their doc's official instructions on how to run langflow via docker:
https://docs.langflow.org/Deployment/deployment-docker

Notice these key steps:
1. Terminal: `git clone https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow.git`
2. Terminal: `cd langflow/docker_example`

That means if you go visit their docker_example folder:
https://github.com/langflow-ai/langflow/tree/main/docker_example

The files are as of 2/2025:
- Dockerfile
- README.md
- docker-compose.yml
- pre.Dockerfile
- pre.docker-compose.yml

The Readme descibes how to run docker langflow using docker compose: `docker compose up`. Langflow assumes you know the basics of docker and docker compose. If you are not familiar, below is an orientation:

----

Dockerfile is used to build an custom image you can run. You do this with the `docker` command.

docker-compose.yml is used to run an image using the `docker compose` command.

Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml can work together IF and only if docker-compose.yml references Dockerfile as the build instead of referencing a remote repository.

In the case of Langflow, Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml are independent. The docker compose file references a remote repository which when you run with `docker compose up` it will download from the internet if not downloaded yet.

---

You may notice there is a "pre." version of Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml. These are not docker features, but instead are alpha versions of Langflow. You can specify the pre file in a path when running either the `docker` command or the `docker compose` command, in order to run the alpha version of langflow instead of the stable final release.

---

Volume. If you notice in docker-compose.yml, there is volume mounting, which means a folder outside the docker helps persist your Langflow saves for the next time you run langflow docker (so it doesn't lose your saved flows).

If on Mac, the `/var/lib/postgresql/data` path you see at docker-compose.yml isn't actually on your hard drive. It's built into a virtual harddrive at Docker Desktop. Like here:
![[Pasted image 20250211221341.png]]


![[Pasted image 20250211221146.png]]

You can get the virtual paths for Docker Desktop (if on Mac), by running:
```
docker volume ls
```

That shows all the volume names, and you inspect a particular volume name for its path:
```
 docker volume inspect docker_example_langflow-postgres
 docker volume inspect docker_example_langflow-data
```
