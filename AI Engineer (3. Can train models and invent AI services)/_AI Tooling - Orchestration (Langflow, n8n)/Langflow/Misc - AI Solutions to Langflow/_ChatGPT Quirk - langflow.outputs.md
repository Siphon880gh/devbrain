What ChatGPT 4o generated even with web search on, it will produce code that uses `langflow.outputs` which has been removed from LangFlow

So you will get this error:
`ModuleNotFoundError: Module langflow.outputs not found. Please install it and try again`

MessageOutput is outdated

Replace with Output:

Output is automatically imported in so we don't need to add any imports at the top of the code.

However, we need to get rid of the old MessageOutput import. Get rid of the highlighted line (gray): `from langflow.outputs import MessageOutput`
