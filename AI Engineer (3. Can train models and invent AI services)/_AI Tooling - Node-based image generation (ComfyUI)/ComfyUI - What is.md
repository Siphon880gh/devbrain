**ComfyUI** is a **node-based graphical interface** for running **Stable Diffusion** image generation workflows. It lets you visually build, modify, and control generative pipelines using blocks (called _nodes_), rather than writing code.

### ðŸ§© What ComfyUI Does

ComfyUI acts as an **orchestration layer** around Stable Diffusion, making it easier to:

- **Customize inference pipelines** (e.g., prompts, models, samplers, upscalers)
    
- **Combine models and tools** (like ControlNet, LoRA, image-to-image, inpainting)
    
- **Experiment with settings** visually without editing scripts
    
- **Create repeatable workflows** with drag-and-drop interfaces

### ðŸ”§ How It Works

- You open ComfyUI in your browser (it's a local web app, usually launched via Python)
    
- You drag nodes like:
    
    - `Load Checkpoint` (model)
        
    - `CLIP Text Encode` (prompt)
        
    - `KSampler` (diffusion)
        
    - `Save Image`
        
- Connect them together like a flowchart
    
- Press **Queue Prompt** to generate an image

### ðŸ§  Why It's Popular

|Feature|Benefit|
|---|---|
|**No coding required**|Great for non-programmers or artists|
|**Modular & visual**|See your pipeline at a glance|
|**Supports advanced models**|ControlNet, LoRAs, SDXL, etc.|
|**Fast & lightweight**|Good performance even on consumer GPUs|
|**Extensible**|Many community-made custom nodes and workflows|

### ðŸš€ Example Use Cases

- Create AI portraits with fine-grained control over style and subject
    
- Build reusable templates for batch generation
    
- Mix-and-match models and prompts to experiment with styles
    
- Use custom nodes for animation, upscaling, or post-processing
