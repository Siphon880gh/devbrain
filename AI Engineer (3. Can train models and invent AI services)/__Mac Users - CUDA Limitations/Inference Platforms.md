Here’s a **comprehensive list of cloud-based AI inference services** that offer GPU runtimes — typically with web IDEs, file browsers, or model-hosting infrastructure. These are ideal when you're working on **model inference**, **fine-tuning**, or **prototyping**, especially from a Mac or a lightweight machine:

## 🖥️ Cloud-Based AI Inference Platforms

| Platform                     | Type                        | GPU Access | Features                                            | Notes                                               |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hugging Face Spaces**      | Hosted models / apps        | ✅          | Gradio/UI hosting, public demos, HF Hub integration | Great for sharing model demos                       |
| **Google Colab / Colab Pro** | Notebook IDE                | ✅          | GPU/TPU runtime, file I/O, notebooks                | Free (with limits); Pro tier offers longer runtimes |
| **Kaggle Notebooks**         | Notebook IDE                | ✅          | Free GPU (Tesla T4), data access, notebook sharing  | Free but slower/limited runtime                     |
| **Paperspace Gradient**      | Notebook IDE + workspace    | ✅          | Jupyter IDE, persistent storage, Docker templates   | Offers both free and paid GPU                       |
| **Replicate**                | Model inference API         | ✅          | Run models via API, shared demos                    | No IDE; API-focused                                 |
| **Modal**                    | Code-based serverless infra | ✅          | GPU jobs as Python functions, CLI and SDK           | For devs comfortable with cloud/code                |
| **RunPod**                   | Custom runtimes             | ✅          | GPU containers, API, terminal access                | More raw access than IDEs                           |
| **Lambda Cloud**             | GPU VMs                     | ✅          | Terminal access, Jupyter via setup                  | More devops-style; for training or inference        |
| **Forefront.ai**             | Hosted API / playground     | ✅          | Model playground, hosted GPT-style agents           | Less control, more plug-and-play                    |
| **NVIDIA NGC**               | Enterprise + notebooks      | ✅          | Jupyter notebooks, pretrained models                | Geared toward enterprise/scientific workloads       |
| **SageMaker Studio Lab**     | Notebook IDE                | ✅          | Free hosted notebooks, small GPU                    | Slower/limited but managed by AWS                   |
| **Vast.AI**                  | GPU rental marketplace      | ✅          | Low-cost GPU VMs, full root access, pay-as-you-go   | Powerful but requires manual setup and management   |

> [!note] Choosing the Right One
> 
> - Use **Hugging Face**, **Colab**, or **Gradient** for fast prototyping
>     
> - Use **RunPod**, **Lambda**, or **Modal** if you need more control over training/inference
>     
> - Use **Replicate** or **Forefront** to just plug into models via API — no setup required
>
