Aka Get Started

This tutorial will cover Langflow using their online service (not local use).

For AI example, we will use RAG which is the loading of documents then asking AI questions that it can answer using your documents. Typically you would upload MD, PDF, or docx files

There are three requirements: langflow account (free), astradb account (free), openai api account (not free but you load in funds).

> [!note] Curious of Langflow’s Business?
> Langflow is open-source. The project was created by a small team based in Brazil and is now owned by DataStax, but it remains free and open-source. The founders have explicitly committed to keeping Langflow open-source, with one of the co-founders stating, "Langflow will forever be free, open-source, and agnostic". The news of the acquisition and the new founders’ commitment here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39933342

> [!note] Curious of AstraDb’s Business?
> DataStax offers AstraDB, a cloud-native, serverless database service built on Apache Cassandra. 
> Apache Cassandra is an open-source, distributed NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across multiple servers14. It was initially developed at Facebook and combines elements of Amazon's Dynamo and Google's Bigtable to create a highly scalable and reliable database solution. Most importantly, Apache Cassandra supports vectors which is important for AI to understand language and different contexts.
