For this tutorial we will use personal Gmail address and create app password

The official instructions on how to setup Gmail app password by n8n is:
[https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/sendemail/gmail/#set-up-the-credential](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/sendemail/gmail/#set-up-the-credential)  

I also wrote a quick guide on how to setup Google app password:

Please create this workflow (your settings dont need to be correct yet):

At Code node:

We are mocking data for email outreach. Let's hard code an object with the property preparedEmail { from,to,subject,message }

Let's use this:
```
return {  
  prepareEmail: {  
    from: "admin@domain.com",  
    to: "lead@domain.com",  
    subject: "Thanks for completing the survey",  
    message: "Hi there. This message went through"  
  }  
}
```

At Send Email node:

You see a lot of fields

Setup the Google credentials first.

Go on here to create an app password for your personal gmail:
- If can't find it, search bar for "create app password"
- For more detailed instructions: [https://codernotes.wengindustries.com/?open=1.%20Create%20Gmail%20app%20password](https://codernotes.wengindustries.com/?open=1.%20Create%20Gmail%20app%20password)  
[http://myaccount.google.com/](http://myaccount.google.com/)

Enter User and Password fields as follows
- Your gmail email address
- Your app password

Enter host, port, SSL/TLSS as follows:
- Host: `smtp.gmail.com`
- Port: `465`
- Enable "SSL/TLS" toggle
- Client Host Name can be left blank

Try connecting/saving for a confirmation that it connected:

Back to the Send Email main settings. Go ahead and just hard code a test run. Send and email from your same email address so you can quickly test it:

Check your actual Gmail inbox:

Another reason for a quick test - see there's a n8n attribution:
![[Pasted image 20250610235519.png]]

You can remove that by loading the option "Append n8n Attribution" then toggling it off:

Let's wire up the node for reals this time.

Run the workflow up to and including the code:
![[Pasted image 20250610235631.png]]

Opening the "Send Email" node, the Input panel on the left will be populated with fields you can drag into the settings. Let's clear the fields of our hard coded tests, then drag the input fields into their places:
