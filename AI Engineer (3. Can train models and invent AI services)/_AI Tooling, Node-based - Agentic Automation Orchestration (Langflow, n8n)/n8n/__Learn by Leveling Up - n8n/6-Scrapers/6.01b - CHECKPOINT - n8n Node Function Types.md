**Retrospection on the function type**:

> [!note] Quick Review: Function type
> Function Types in functional math or machine learning contexts refer to:
> - Single-input, single-output (SISO)
> - Multiple-input, single-output (MISO)
> - Multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO)
>   
>  In the context of n8n nodes
>  In n8n, a node can either receive only one input at a time or receive all inputs at once, and the node can either output only one input at a time or output all at one time). If only one at a time, then you'll likely have to loop through iterations or it will only work with the first input (dropping all other inputs afterwards)

Notice that the SerpAPI receives three inputs and outputs three at once. Therefore, SerpAPI is MIMO.
