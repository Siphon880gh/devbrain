This is a continuation of the previous lesson [[3.03 Generate weekly sales report - Mock Data, Date Diff, Flatten Data, Filter Last 7 days]].

We have filtered in salespersons who closed a sales in the last 7 days from the "Today" date.

Now we will transform the data into something report worthy.

This is what we have so far:
![[Pasted image 20250611025349.png]]

---

We will explore many nodes -- Aggregate, Summarize, Sort, Rename keys, Edit fields -- in an effort to find the best nodes to make a useful sales report. Along the way, you learn these nodes.

---

Let's explore if Aggregate node is useful for our sales reports

Add Aggregate after the Filter:

## Explore Aggregate

Before we decide if Aggregate node is it, let's explore what it does.

Keep in mind that our data that Aggregate will modify is:
```
[
  {
    "salesperson": "Alice",
    "region": "West",
    "amount": 500,
    "date": "2025-06-08",
    "dayDifference": 2
  },
  {
    "salesperson": "Bob",
    "region": "East",
    "amount": 300,
    "date": "2025-06-05",
    "dayDifference": 5
  },
  {
    "salesperson": "Charlie",
    "region": "North",
    "amount": 750,
    "date": "2025-06-09",
    "dayDifference": 1
  },
  {
    "salesperson": "Diana",
    "region": "South",
    "amount": 320,
    "date": "2025-06-07",
    "dayDifference": 3
  },
  {
    "salesperson": "Alice",
    "region": "West",
    "amount": 180,
    "date": "2025-06-06",
    "dayDifference": 4
  },
  // ...
]
```

### Aggregate can extract values of key A into a single array
>[!note] Expand...
> Aggregate Individual Field "amount". Now everyone's amounts earned will be saved as an array under the property "amount"
> ![[Pasted image 20250611052902.png]]
> 
> ^ And if you had added more fields to aggregate? The object will contain another array property:
> - Notice that there are two Alice in inputs and there are two Alice in outputs. Aggregate in this form just extract values - it does not collapse duplicates.
> ![[Pasted image 20250611053652.png]]
> 
> **TLDR:**
> In other words, you can aggregate a property that all the sales objects share into a single array. 
> 


### Aggregate to nest items deeper
> [!note] Expand...
> 
> Let's change Aggregate mode to: All Item Data (Into a Single List)
> 
> Notice here Aggregate "Includes" fields you want to keep. The "Includes" field is set to "Specified Fields"
> 
> After executing this step, the data structure is maintained except it's nested deeper. We leave the "Put Output in Field" input empty for now:
> ![[Pasted image 20250611054116.png]]
> 
> ^The nested structure is difficult to parse for later nodes. That's where "Put Output in Field" comes in. You wrap the deeper data structure with a key. That's the correct way. n8n probably overlooked checking if you had typed into "Put Output in Field": 
> ![[Pasted image 20250611054217.png]]
>
> What if for Include, we choose the opposite for "Includes" field: "All Fields Except". As long as we list the other fields instead, we get the same result:
> ![[Pasted image 20250611054506.png]]
> 
> **TLDR:**
> You can aggregate all sales objects into an array. The array is stored under a property because in JS object format, all data must be named under a key. Although you can remove fields using this method, that's not the primary reason for the Aggregate node.

Aggregate is useless for sales reports then. Lets swap it out for another node we can explore.

---
## Explorer Summarize

Let's swap in a Summarize node:
![[Pasted image 20250611061649.png]]


Before we decide if Summarize node is it, let's explore what it does.

### Summarize can sum a property shared among all salespersons into a single figure
> [!note] Expand...
> - Aggregate by `summing` the field `amount`
> - Leave "Fields to Split By empty"
> - The usually hidden Output Format option can be ignored. Because we are not splitting fields or grouping by fields, either option in Output Format will still result in one figure.
> ![[Pasted image 20250611061836.png]]
> ^ It could be helpful as part of a sales report, to have the total sales revenues for the last 7 days. But it doesn't give us insight into how much each individual salesperson made in the week
> 


Curious what happens if you had chosen another mode of Aggregation other than "Sum?" With "Concatenate", it just concatenates all the objects' shared property into a csv string:
![[Pasted image 20250611071050.png]]

How about Aggregation mode on "Append"? It just creates an array out of the objects' shared property:
![[Pasted image 20250611071319.png]]

### Summarize can reindex objects to have their indexes be keys named after a property value
> [!note] Expand...
> - Aggregate by `summing` the field `amount`
> - Add to "Fields to Split By empty": `salesperson`
> ![[Pasted image 20250611063606.png]]
> ^ A salesperson name is used to form a key name. That key points to a summation object that summed field(s). The "Primary ID" that identifies the entity is the salesperson's name which is unique. This array is a set, so having the same entity more than once is not allowed; If a salesperson like Alice has made two sales the last 7 days, her two sales objects are collapsed together.
> 
> **TLDR**: 
> Although having the two Alice collapsed together is desirable as a useable format - Overall, this is not in a useable format. A more useable format is an array of objects. The names should stay as fields.
> 


### Summarize can collapse records that are the same entity, summing their fields
> [!note] Expand...
> - Aggregate by `summing` the field `amount`
> - Add to "Fields to Split By empty": `salesperson`
> - Set "Output Format" to `Each Split in a Separate Item` (May have to load the option field)
>  
> We see a salesperson like Alice who has made two sales the last 7 days, are collapsed into one Alice. We see that out of 7 items input, it's been collapsed as needed down to 4 items. Furthermore, this is an array of objects (akin to a spreadsheet of rows). This is indeed useful format and we can make a report out of this. 
> ![[Pasted image 20250611071658.png]]
> 
> But the other fields are missing. Can we add them to the same field where `salesperson` is? There are no other options to include fields, so we added to "Fields to Split By": `salesperson, region, date`. We've not included dateDifference because it's no longer a relevant number since we already finished filtered in the sales that are within the last 7 days. Oh, no! There are multiple Alices now. Notice the number of outputs have swollen back up to match the number of inputs:
>  ![[Pasted image 20250611065056.png]]
>  
> You must understand a fundamental rule here before attempting to fix it. "Fields to Split." This is like Microsoft Excel's Pivot Table. You're not supposed to include the date if they're all unique. Region was okay because it happens that the same entities share the same names and the same regions. If you must have dates, then under each entity should be an array of dates. You achieve this by adding another field to summarize, but have the aggregation mode in "append" or "concatenate":
> 1 of 2... if append:
> ![[Pasted image 20250611073151.png]]
> 
> 2 of 2... if Concatenate:
> ![[Pasted image 20250611073221.png]]
> 

Let's cover what we would like in the report. It should include how much total all the salespersons make as a team. It should also include how much each salesperson made. Therefore, there are two useful Summarize stats:
- Summarize can sum a property shared among all salespersons into a single figure
- Summarize can collapse records that are the same entity, summing their fields

We generate two separate reports from Filter (the expectation is in the future we will merge them):
![[Pasted image 20250611073557.png]]

## Explore more ways to create an impactful sales report

### Sort specific column

Looking into the per salesperson profits:
![[Pasted image 20250611073718.png]]

It'd be great if we sort by highest performer based on the total profits they made. We add a Sort:
![[Pasted image 20250611073753.png]]

We double click into the Sort node 

n8n as of 6/2025 will be a bit random about this.

Sometimes the Sort node defaults to a coding interface:
![[Pasted image 20250611073819.png]]
- If that's the case, where it says "myField", replace that with "sum_amount" because that's the field we're sorting. You may have to adjust the code a bit if you wanted Descending sort. 

Sometimes the Sort node defaults to no-code screen:
![[Pasted image 20250611074123.png]]
- If that's the case, then drag and drop the sum_amount into Field Name for sorting. Or type into it: `sum_amount`. Make sure to change the Order to descending

On either screen, you want a sorted output like this:
![[Pasted image 20250611074239.png]]

We can tell at a snapshot that Charlie is the top performer in the last 7 days.

### Rename fields

We are getting close to that spreadsheet report. The field name "salesperson" makes sense. But the "sum_amount" sounds awkward (Summarize node normally prefixed the Summarize mode into the field name). And "concatenated_date" sounds too jargony.

We now add Rename key nodes:
![[Pasted image 20250611074526.png]]

We can rename the top Summarize field to "Total Profit"
Name the other fields for the bottom Summarize to "Profit", "Closed Dates", "Salesperson".

It'll look much nicer with these spellings for column headings.

Renaming keys is easy. This is how their interface looks. Drag and drop or type the original key name. Then in the next field, give it a new field name (spaces okay). You can click "Add new key" to rename more fields:
![[Pasted image 20250611074735.png]]

Here's a more extensive example:
![[Pasted image 20250611075358.png]]

### Edit Field Values

One more thing annoying my OCD. Going back to the salespersons report:
- I want `${month}-${day}-${year}` instead of `${year}-${month}-${day}`;`
![[Pasted image 20250611074239.png]]

The dates are in an annoying format. I'm dropping in an "Edit Fields (Set)" to programmatically change their dates. So far the workflow looks like:
![[Pasted image 20250611075032.png]]


I double-click into the "Edit Fields" node:
- When adding a field to set, you can programmatically override the field's value to render dynamically. However, the field is too small. 
	- Firstly, switch from Fixed to Expression
	- Secondly, move your mouse over to the bottom right of the override value field to have an "Open Edit Window" button show. Click that to open the code editor.
![[Pasted image 20250611075601.png]]

The code editor:
![[Pasted image 20250611080038.png]]

Paste in this code:
```
{{ 
$input.item.json["Closed Dates"]
  .split(',')
  .map(date => {
    const [year, month, day] = date.split('-');
    return `${month}-${day}-${year}`;
  })
  .join(', ')
}}
```

The result:
- Make sure to enable "Include Other Input Fields" so that the other fields don't get discarded from the final output.
![[Pasted image 20250611080331.png]]

This is satisfactory. We'll work on combining the two reports (total profits and salesperson profits) into one report

---

## Merge Node (Append) - Combine into sales report

We add a Merge node at the very end to merge the two branches together:
![[Pasted image 20250611080551.png]]

Double click into Merge
- The input panel doesn't even matter
- Make sure it knows there are two inputs. 
- Then run Execute:
  ![[Pasted image 20250611080713.png]]

In other words, this is the result:
```
[
  {
    "Total Profit": 3540
  },
  {
    "Profits": 1640,
    "Closed Dates": "06-09-2025, 06-04-2025",
    "Salesperson": "Charlie"
  },
  {
    "Profits": 900,
    "Closed Dates": "06-05-2025, 06-10-2025",
    "Salesperson": "Bob"
  },
  {
    "Profits": 680,
    "Closed Dates": "06-08-2025, 06-06-2025",
    "Salesperson": "Alice"
  },
  {
    "Profits": 320,
    "Closed Dates": "06-07-2025",
    "Salesperson": "Diana"
  }
]
```

You can now pipe it into any report delivery system.
- Email the report?
	- Pipe into a Code node in order to write a HTML email report from these properties. Then pipe into a "Send Email" node. The next folder on using n8n with AI Application will cover how to email.
	  ![[Pasted image 20250611081157.png]]
- Save into Google Sheet?
	- You could get rid of the Merge node and in its place are two Google Sheet nodes. You could save the Salesperson performance data into one sheet and the total profits into another sheet. In addition, you may want Google Sheet nodes that create spreadsheets based on the time (not shown):
	  ![[Pasted image 20250611081248.png]]
