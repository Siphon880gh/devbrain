We will create a testing scenario where we expect a value to be equal to 1, but the actual value is 2, so it equates to false. The if node then sends the false to debughelper which will log a helpful error message to Google Sheets. This simulates a failed automated test not only throwing but also logging to a google sheet.

Please create this workflow (your settings dont need to be correct yet):

At Code node:
- Run once for all items, Javascript
```
return {  
  expectedVal: 1,  
  actualVal: 2  
}
```

---

At If node:

- It's truthy if the actual value passes the test. It's falsy if the actual value does not match the expected value.
- Drag and drop the fields from the left "Input" panel into the Condition fields
- Or you could manually type in `{{$json.expectedVal}}`  and `{{$json.actualVal}}` . The `$json` represents the current input.

At DebugHelper

- Falsy or failed test should go to DebugHelper which can help enrich messages into an error message.
- The default error message field can have a message like "Node has thrown an error" which is too generic of an error. We're going to code in expressions into the error message.
- As you type in code or expressions inside of `{{.. }}`, get used to momentarily pausing in the middle of typing to bring up Autocomplete suggestions, their descriptions, and example code snippets. This can be helpful as you're still learning the n8n coding.
- ![[Pasted image 20250610214244.png]]
- Have the DebugHelper not only give a generic error message but enrich it with the entire input by having `{{$input.all().toJsonString()}}` .
- Notice in the Result Preview (gray text underneath the Error Message) and the Output (after you clicked "Execute step") that the enriched data includes a "pairItem" property that helps with debugging.

Let's setup the Google Spreadsheet node's credentials

You actually have two secured options for Google Sheets:
![[Pasted image 20250702150457.png]]

You could create a "Google Sheets account" but then you're using OAuth2 which is a bit excessive since this is not a case where a user visiting your website authenticates by logging into Google. If you had setup "Google Sheets account"/OAuth2 you the n8n user will go through the OAuth2 flow pages (a button to OAuth2 authenticate will appear on the Google Sheets account credentials modal). You also have to paste in client id and secret at n8n and copy the callback url from n8n to google cloud. Not only is this more work, it's totally unnecessary.

❌ Unnecessary, let's not do OAuth2:
![[Pasted image 20250702150821.png]]

A "Google Service Account" is the most appropriate because it's pretty secured with two pieces of authenticating information (you need both password aka private key and the service account email address) and you don't need to copy n8n to google cloud, and you don't need to go through extra screens, so the work is reasonable.

Not shown in screenshot is API key credentials. That is not a very secured way of doing things anyways because it's only one piece of authenticating information.

Choosing Google Service account:

I suggest splitting the screen into n8n and the actual Google Sheet so we can see if the spreadsheet successfully updates.
![[Pasted image 20250610214154.png]]

^If your spreadsheet already has headers in the first row, but they don’t match the field names in your input (like `expectedValue` and `actualValue`), it might look like nothing was added. In reality, the data may have been appended far to the right—Google Sheets will place unmatched fields in new columns instead of under existing headers. Just scroll to the right to find them.

If this works, that's great! Let's discuss the workflow that we currently have and a way to improve it.

Referring back to the workflow:
![[Pasted image 20250610214128.png]]

You notice we haven't connected the True connector. This is intentional. Let's say this is an automated test before the rest of your workflow. Then the true connector will be where you connect to the rest of the workflow.

## Best Practices

There are many ways to log the message and many possible formats for the message

Message crafting - here are some guidelines:
- It's helpful for the person going to fix the problem to know:
	- what time did this error occur, at which workflow (in case you will have this same spreadsheet for multiple workflows), at what part of stage of the workflow, at what level of concern is it (debug, info, notice, warning, error, critical/fatal)
- You can retrieve the name of the previous node. This is especially useful when logging errors to a Google Sheet, as it helps identify which path in a multi-branch workflow led to the failure. To get the previous node’s name, use:
```
console.log($prevNode.name)
```

Example crafting the message:
![[Pasted image 20250702195320.png]]

Therefore, a best practice of the workflow:
![[Pasted image 20250702195537.png]]

And one sub-workflow that logs all the errors:
![[Pasted image 20250702195618.png]]

The debug helper node looks like this:
- 1 of 2:
  ![[Pasted image 20250702195753.png]]
- 2 of 2: Has an error outlet that connects to the Google Sheet
