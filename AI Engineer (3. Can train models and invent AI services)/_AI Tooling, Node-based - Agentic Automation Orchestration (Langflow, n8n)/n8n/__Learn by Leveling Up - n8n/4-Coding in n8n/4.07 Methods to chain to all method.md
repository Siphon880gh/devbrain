We've covered in a previous lesson [[4.05 Special variables so far]] that the `all()` method are helpful in certain use cases, including:
- Converting into json for the AI agent to get context about your inputs
- Seeing all the inputs so far at a "Code" node for debugging purposes

All has other methods you can chain to it. Let's use :

Those methods you can chain to the all method are:
- length
- **last** - tells the AI the final input
- includes
- map
- filter
- append

Wait, another node shows even more methods:

And note that although AI Agent lets you access `$input.all().last()` per its Intellisense Hint, Code node DOES NOT allow you to access `last()`. So there are some differences.
