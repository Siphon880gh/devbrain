Let's create a mocked data (you learned to mock data at [[3.03 Generate weekly sales report - Mock Data, Date Diff, Flatten Data, Filter Last 7 days]])

And in that mocked data, each input has an index from 0 to N

We want to transform the mocked data to a new dataset with index from 1 to N+1

---

Create a trigger then two Code nodes like this:

For "Code: Mock Data":
```
return [
  {a:0},
  {a:1},
  {a:2}
]
```

For "Code: Advanced Indexes":
```
for (let item of $input.all()) {
  item.json.a += 1;
}

return $input.all();
```

Or:
```
return $input.all().map(input=> { 
  return {
    ...input.json,
    a: input.json.a + 1
  }
});
```

We can see that the advanced indexes worked:

However that was implemented imperatively using a Code node to advance the indexes

---

Let's see what happens when we use "Edit Field (Set)" node to advance the index declarative. 

It's much clearer at the workflow level:

And if you double click into the "Edit Field" node, you see the coding to recalculate the value for the "a" field is much easier to read coding:

And that's the beauty of having "Edit Fields" to change the field values. You don't always need a Code node.
