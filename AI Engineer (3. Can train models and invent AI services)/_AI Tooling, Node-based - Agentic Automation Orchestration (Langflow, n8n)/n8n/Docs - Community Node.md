## 🌐 How to View Docs for an n8n Community Node

For **Community Nodes** in n8n, documentation is typically hosted on their **npm repository page**.

To access it:
1. **Double-click the community node** in your workflow.
2. In the node editor, click the **"Docs"** button near the tabs.

This will open the node’s official page on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com) in a new tab. For example, https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-serpapi

The page usually contains a `README.md` file, which may include:

* 📄 Setup instructions
* ⚙️ Supported operations or parameters
* 🧩 Example use cases or sample workflows
* 📦 Sometimes installation or compatibility notes

Since these nodes are contributed by the community, documentation quality may vary—but the README is your go-to source for how the node works and how to use it effectively.
