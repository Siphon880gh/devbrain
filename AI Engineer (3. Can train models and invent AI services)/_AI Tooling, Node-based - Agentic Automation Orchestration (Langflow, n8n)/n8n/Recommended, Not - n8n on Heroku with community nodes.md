### ⚠️ Using n8n on Heroku with Community Nodes? Here’s What You Need to Know

This applies to you if:

- You're running **n8n on Heroku**, including in a **Docker container**
- You access your instance via the Heroku app URL (to receive webhooks or edit workflows)
- You’ve installed **community nodes**
- You frequently see an **"Unrecognized node type"** error in your workflows, often daily when you log back into n8n to manage your workflows.

If so, read on—your setup is likely running into Heroku platform limitations.

### ❌ Why Community Nodes Keep Disappearing

Heroku uses an **ephemeral filesystem**, which resets on every:
- Dyno restart
- Deploy
- Idle timeout (common on free/eco plans)

When this happens, any installed **community nodes are wiped**, causing n8n to show “Unrecognized node type” errors. You can temporarily fix this by going to **Settings > Community Nodes** and reinstalling the node by name—but the problem will return after the next restart.

This makes Heroku unsuitable for persistent use of community nodes in n8n.

### 🪣 What About S3 Hero Dev?

Heroku provides an add-on called **S3 Hero Dev**, which:
- Gives you access to an Amazon S3 bucket
- Exposes credentials as environment variables
- Lets your app read/write objects from S3

✅ This is useful for storing files or logs from your workflows.  
❌ **But it does _not_ solve the issue of missing community nodes**, because it does **not allow Docker containers to mount S3 as a local filesystem**.

---

### 🔒 Why You Can’t Mount S3 on Heroku with Docker

You may have seen tools like:
- [`s3fs`](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse)
- [`goofys`](https://github.com/kahing/goofys)

These can mount an S3 bucket as a local directory—**but they rely on FUSE**.

#### 🚫 FUSE Isn’t Supported on Heroku

FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) allows userspace programs to implement a fully functional file system—but it requires:
- Elevated privileges
- Kernel module support

**Heroku does not support either**, even inside Docker builds. That means:
- You can’t use `s3fs`, `goofys`, or similar tools
- Even modifying your Dockerfile to install these tools and launching with a `.sh` script won’t work
- You **cannot mount** S3 into the container like a volume

In short: **Heroku is not compatible with FUSE-based mounting**, so there's no way to make community node installs persist through this method.

### 🛠️ Can't Leave Heroku? A Workaround if Speed Not an Issue

If you're not ready to move off Heroku, there's a partial workaround using:
#### `N8N_REINSTALL_MISSING_PACKAGES=true`

This environment variable tells n8n to reinstall missing community nodes automatically when it starts.

However, there's a catch:
- **Container restarts take time**, and the n8n server may not be immediately available
- You’ll likely need a **startup script or external monitor** that:
    1. Pings the Heroku URL every few minutes
    2. Waits until the app becomes reachable (i.e., not 503 or down)
    3. Triggers a health check or webhook call once n8n is fully ready
    4. If your app relies on n8n, consider showing a loading screen, loading sprite, or loading message to the user until a successful connection to n8n. Community nodes usually reinstall quickly, so the delay is minimal.

Note: This issue is most common on **eco or free plans**, which automatically shut down dynos after 30 minutes of inactivity. When the dyno restarts, the community nodes are lost due to Heroku’s **ephemeral filesystem**. Upgrading to a higher plan that avoids automatic shutdowns can help reduce these interruptions, but won’t fully solve the persistence issue.

How to add this environmental variable? Add to "Settings" -> "Reveal Config Vars". Then add `N8N_REINSTALL_MISSING_PACKAGES` set to `true`

> [!note] Test if this auto install still works on your current version of n8n
> Test the same version n8n locally. You can run container passing in the environmental variable like so:
> ```
> (base) wengffung@Wengs-MBP-New ~ % docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n --env N8N_REINSTALL_MISSING_PACKAGES=true docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
> ```
> Visit community nodes list to confirm your nodes are not broken (at least not yet - we will break them)
> ![[Pasted image 20250612051834.png]]
> 
> Let's try to break the community node. Run command to get name of volume we mounted (likely will be n8n_data, but anyways...): ` docker volume ls`. 
> 
> At Docker Desktop, open up that corresponding volume:
> ![[Pasted image 20250612052013.png]]
> 
> Open up the folder nodes -> node_modules -> desired community node to test what happens if you corrupt it
> ![[Pasted image 20250612052157.png]]
> 
> Back to the community nodes list, we can see that the corresponding community node is now corrupted. Do not re-install it:
> ![[Pasted image 20250612052318.png]]
> 
> Close and restart the container with the environmental flag option. Then revisit the community nodes page (or refresh it if you're still on that page). You'll see that the community node is reinstalled automatically without you having to manually reinstall it:
> ![[Pasted image 20250612051834.png]]
> 
> If you had not passed the auto reinstall environmental flag, it would have stayed corrupted, possibly breaking your workflow that depends on that node.

### ✅ Real Alternatives: Use a Platform with Persistent Volumes

To run n8n with community nodes reliably, move to a platform that supports persistent storage:

| Platform              | Persistent Storage | Notes                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **VPS/Dedicated**     | ✅ Yes             | Full control, great for custom setups |
| **AWS ECS/Lightsail** | ✅ Yes             | Scalable, ideal for production use    |
| **Fly.io**            | ✅ Yes             | Lightweight, supports volumes         |
| **Render.com**        | ✅ Yes             | Docker support + persistent disk      |
| **Railway.app**       | ✅ Yes             | Simple deployment, supports volumes   |

These platforms let your container retain installed nodes and other local changes even after restarts or redeploys.

### 🔁 Summary

If you're using Heroku to host n8n with community nodes:
- You’ll run into issues with missing nodes due to Heroku’s **ephemeral filesystem**
- **S3 Hero Dev** can help with file storage, but **can’t be used to persist node installations**
- You **can’t mount S3** using FUSE-based tools like `s3fs` or `goofys`, because Heroku lacks FUSE support
- If you must stay on Heroku with community nodes, set `N8N_REINSTALL_MISSING_PACKAGES=true` and build a retry loop that waits for the dyno to be ready
- The best fix is to migrate to a platform that supports **persistent storage**.
