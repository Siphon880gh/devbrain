That opens:
[https://dashboard.heroku.com/new?template=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fn8n-io%2Fn8n-heroku%2Ftree%2Fmain](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new?template=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fn8n-io%2Fn8n-heroku%2Ftree%2Fmain)

Behind the scene, it's using https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-heroku

Will always create a new heroku app and will always use latest version of n8n
