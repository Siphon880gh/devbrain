There are a lot. Actually notice there's a horizontal scrollbar:

Select your workflow JSON file from computer storage.

Previous method of clicking Import didn't work on a JSON file you downloaded online? Try dragging the JSON file into a blank canvas!

People share their workflows (which are flowchart of nodes). They can be referred to as workflows, templates, or JSON.

You should always vet if a template is worth downloading. A template with such low stars is probably not worth checking out:

The workflow can be very permissible what it outputs (letting you prompt it) or it can be a very niche generator.

Here's a niche generator: One click to generate Ultraman funny type pictures

Huge caveat about OpenArt's templates

Many OpenArt AI workflows are not intended to work with ComfyUI. Recall that OpenArt is the online platform and Comfy UI is the local app platform. You can drag and drop a workflow json file you download from OpenArt's template community, but very likely you'll run into missing node problems, and the nodes can't be found in the Node store.
