There are several forms of ComfyUI, although the interface are all similar. This is why we have a folder called `ComfyUI - _Core (Applies to all platforms)`

On choosing the correct form of ComfyUI, refer to [[_Choosing the correct form of ComfyUI]]

On LEARNING the nodes in ComfyUI, refer to the Core folder's notes.
