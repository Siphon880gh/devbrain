**INSTALLATION MUST - ComfyUI Manager**

Note: ComfyUI Manager no longer part of ComfyUI installation out of the box. You have to install manually.

You should install **ComfyUI Manager**. It helps you install custom nodes you may need—along with their model dependencies—either by pasting a GitHub link or by clicking an automatic install button that downloads any missing nodes for you.

Often when you open a workflow from a YouTuber or shared file, you’ll see an error saying some nodes are missing. ComfyUI Manager can detect those and install them quickly so the workflow runs properly.

To install, refer to [[ComfyUI - _Installation Additional - ComfyUI Manager]]
