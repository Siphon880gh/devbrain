Sometimes you need the exact value from a node to google for issues or downloading. Unfortunately, you can't just copy and paste from a node field in the graph view as of 2026 Feb. 

A fast way to copy a text value from nodes is:
	- Right click the node -> Properties -> Select the property and it'll give you the option to copy

Depending on ComfyUI version, it might not let you copy from the field. In that case, there's another way to copy text value despite it being longer to do:

- Export the Workflow JSON file with: `Icon -> File -> Export`. 
- Open the json file, and search partial value of the filename, then copy the entire value:

Now you have the full text value to google issues or download files
