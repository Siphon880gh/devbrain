Export a workflow as an API Workflow json file:

This workflow json file will be much smaller than a normal workflow json file (that you can import in). The API workflow json file will be submitted to a ComfyUI API server to create the workflow on the fly and be able to use it. Hot tip - Name your workflow as an API Workflow especially if you have a lot of json files.
