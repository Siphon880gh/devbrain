### Windows User?

If you have a decent NVIDIA GPU, you're in luck — the Windows App is **free to use for most local workflows** with ComfyUI. You only run into limitations if you're trying to use templates or features that connect to external APIs, which usually **require a subscription**.

If your GPU isn’t strong enough to run ComfyUI smoothly, you have a few options:

- **Upgrade your GPU** (if your system supports it),
- **Use cloud GPU services** (outlined below), or
- **Accept slower performance**, depending on your workflow.

If you don’t have an NVIDIA GPU at all:

- **Upgrade to a compatible NVIDIA GPU** (if your motherboard allows),
- Or stick to **cloud-based alternatives**.


**Note:** Windows desktops typically perform much better than laptops for AI workloads like ComfyUI due to superior cooling and power capabilities.
