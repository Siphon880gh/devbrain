Avoid using the ComfyUI Mac app unless your use case is extremely simple and doesnâ€™t require NVIDIA, CUDA, or GPU acceleration. If you do need more advanced features, youâ€™ll have to manually replace models with CPU/MPS-compatible versions developed by other AI engineers â€” and only if such models even exist for your use case.

Even then, Mac setups often require additional configuration tweaks (like setting environment variables or passing specific flags such as `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1 python3 main.py --force-fp16 --use-split-cross-attention --cpu`). These kinds of customizations are only possible in the Python web app version of ComfyUI â€” not the Mac app.

Here are some examples of users running into limitations with the Mac app and talk about solutions that only can be applied to the Python web app version:

- [GitHub Issue #4165 â€“ Mac compatibility and configuration problems](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/issues/4165)

Yes, ComfyUI at comfy.com does officially offer a Mac app â€” but their presentation of Mac support can be misleading.
