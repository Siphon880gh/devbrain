Huge caveat about OpenArt's templates

Many OpenArt AI workflows include extra or overly complex nodes that aren't actually needed. You can safely remove some of these without breaking the workflow if you understand the nodes enough. Also, several workflows rely on outdated nodes, which is often why they no longer function properly.

There is consensus on this:
- From https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/1drqv3g/is_it_supposed_to_be_this_difficult_to_use_other/
- "You go through a period where you troubleshoot more than you actually generate pictures"
- "if you’re using downloaded workflows, I usually can’t ever get them working perfectly unless they’re really basic. But what I get from downloaded workflows is knowledge. I inspect them to see how they’re being used, then borrow ideas or elements to build my own workflow.
- "If you really want to get them working, you might need to disable certain nodes that just aren’t working. And sometimes, especially for older workflows, you’ll need to replace outdated nodes with their current counterparts."
