This level up tutorial series refers to ComfyUI v0.3.43. Does not matter if the computer software or the python web app because the graphical interface remains the same.

To select a particular version of ComfyUI to install as a python web app, check out the release tags at Github repo, then you clone and install per [[_ComfyUI Python Web App - Local - SETUP]]:
https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI

As for the software app (either window or mac), their official website ([comfy.org/download](https://www.comfy.org/download)) does not prominently display the current version as of June 2025. But the downloaded file's filename will have the version number. Double click the installer file and follow the instructions to install it.
