## The Dependencies-Platform Recommendation

When you start a lesson, you may see a note at the top about what kind of computer or setup is needed. These notes matter because not every workflow runs on every machine. For example, Macs generally support fewer workflows and nodes than Windows or Linux. Still, some lessons are designed to work on common systems, and when a lesson says it’s stable for most computers, that usually means it should run fine on something like a **baseline MacBook Pro with an M1 chip (2021)**. In those cases, you can usually run everything locally using **ComfyUI**, which is free.

Sometimes, though, a lesson will say it requires a **dependency-resolved system** or a **CUDA computer**. A dependency-resolved system just means your environment needs certain components installed before the workflow will run. If you try opening one of these workflows locally, you might see errors about missing nodes or models. Often you can fix this using **ComfyUI Manager** (installed separately in newer ComfyUI versions), but sometimes extra manual steps are needed, such as:

- installing missing nodes through ComfyUI Manager
- downloading required models or nodes into the correct folders (paths you usually note during setup)
- running terminal commands to adjust settings or environment variables
- fixing Python package conflicts
- installing dependencies manually, for example: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

The difficulty of resolving dependencies can vary a lot. Some workflows run after a quick fix, while others require significant troubleshooting. Another complication is that tutorials can become outdated quickly because **ComfyUI frequently changes folder paths, naming conventions, syntax, and installation steps** across versions, builds, and platforms. If a lesson warns that dependency requirements are high, it may actually be easier to use a cloud platform built for ComfyUI instead of configuring everything locally.

If the lesson specifically says **CUDA required**, that means it needs an NVIDIA GPU. Macs and systems without NVIDIA graphics usually can’t run those workflows locally. In that situation, using a cloud service such as **RunComfy** is typically the practical option.

As of February 2026, RunComfy costs about **$30 per month** and includes around **$10 in usage credit**. A capable GPU server there costs roughly **$1 per hour**, and even with that level of hardware, video generation can still take several minutes. One important limitation is that when you stop a server — whether manually or automatically — any models you downloaded onto that machine are removed. Because billing is hourly, some users connect their account to a **Privacy.com virtual card** so they can set spending limits and avoid unexpected charges.

## Quick Setup Decision Guide — Before You Start a Lesson

Start here and follow the path that matches your situation.

---

### 1️⃣ Does the lesson say **“Stable for most computers”**?

**Yes →**  
You can run it locally.

- Works on typical machines (baseline example: **MacBook Pro M1, 2021**)
- Use **local ComfyUI (free)**
- No special hardware required

**No → go to Step 2**

---

### 2️⃣ Does it say **“Dependency-resolved system required”**?

**Yes →**  
You _might_ still run it locally, but expect setup work.

You may need to:
- install missing nodes via **ComfyUI Manager**
- manually download models/nodes into correct folders
- run terminal commands for fixes
- install Python requirements files
- adjust environment variables

👉 If you’re comfortable troubleshooting → try local first  
👉 If you have been troubleshooting and the dependency and conflict resolutions are too numerous taking hours -> skip frustration and use a cloud platform
👉 If not → skip frustration and use a cloud platform

**No → go to Step 3**

---

### 3️⃣ Does it say **“CUDA required”**?

**Yes →**

- Requires **NVIDIA GPU**
    
- Macs and non-NVIDIA systems won’t work locally
    
- Use a cloud service (ex: RunComfy)
    

**No →**  
Local setup should work with some troubleshooting.

## When Cloud Is the Better Choice

Consider using a cloud platform like **RunComfy** if:

- dependency requirements look complex
- tutorials seem outdated or confusing
- you don’t want to debug environment errors
- you don’t have an NVIDIA GPU
- you want the fastest performance

**Typical costs (Feb 2026):**

- About **$30/month plan** (when no annual discount) https://www.runcomfy.com/pricing
- Includes about **$10 usage credit**
- GPU server ≈ **$1/hour**
- Video generations may still take several minutes unless you go for higher quality GPU servers
- Consider when turning a GPU server on: All manually downloaded files via wget in their terminal will erase when Stopped or Auto Stopped

Important note:
> When a cloud server stops (manual or auto-stop), downloaded models are usually deleted.

Tip:
- Some users link a **Privacy.com card** to set spending limits.

✅ **Simple rule of thumb:**

- Easy lesson → run local
- Medium setup → try local if technical
- CUDA or complex dependencies → use cloud
