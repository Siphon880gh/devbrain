Dependency-Platform Notes:
This will work for most computers (Baseline MacBook Pro with M1 chip from 2021).

Learning Method:
Opening a template and following along the nodes

---

Use Template under All -> Search "Image-Turbo Text to Image":
![[Pasted image 20260223005117.png]]

In case ComfyUI removed that template, backup is at [[Backup - Image Z Turbo]]

You'll get a workflow like this:
![[Pasted image 20260223005249.png]]

But if you expand the node "Text to Image (Z-Image-Turbo)" by clicking the expand icon, you'll get:
![[Pasted image 20260223005326.png]]

Notice the breadcrumbs `image_z_image_turbo / Text to Image (Z-Image-Turbo)` - that visually cues you have entered/expanded a node.

Also notice that many of these nodes are familiar from the previous lessons:
- Load diffusion modal
- Text Prompt
- Setting up latent image (invisible math picture)
- KSampler
- VAE Decode

Only thing different is the sampling model.
