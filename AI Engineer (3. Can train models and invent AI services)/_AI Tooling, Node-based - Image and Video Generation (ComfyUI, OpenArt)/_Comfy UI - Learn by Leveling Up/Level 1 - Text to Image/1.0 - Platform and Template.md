Dependency-Platform Notes:
This will work for most computers (Baseline MacBook Pro with M1 chip from 2021).

Learning Method:
Opening a template and following along the nodes

---

Use Template under Getting Started -> Image Generation:

You'll get a workflow like this:

You can simplify the workflow so it's easier to follow along:

And in case ComfyUI has removed it: [[Backup - Text Generation]]

---

Make sure there's at least a positive prompt at the CLIP node. Then click Run at the top. After several minutes find out if successful.

If there's an error, see if it's complaining about a missing model or checkpoint. Refer to [[ComfyUI - MISSING NODES]] on getting a specific file in this case (not a whole repo)

When template works, proceed to next lesson
