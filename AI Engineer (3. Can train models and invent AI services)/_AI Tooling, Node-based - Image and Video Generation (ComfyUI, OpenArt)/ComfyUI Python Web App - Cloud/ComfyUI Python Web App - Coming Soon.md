Here’s your combined, professional, and actionable **mega guide** on running ComfyUI with cloud 
If you’re using a Mac and want to get the most out of ComfyUI, you may be tempted to try the official ComfyUI Mac app. However, despite its existence, **Mac support is limited and often misleading** — especially for users looking to do anything more advanced than basic CPU inference.

## 🚫 Why You Should Avoid the Mac App

ComfyUI’s Mac app may appear to offer native support, but in practice:

- It lacks support for **CUDA/NVIDIA GPU acceleration**, which is essential for fast image generation.
    
- Running large models or workflows on CPU or Apple's MPS backend is unreliable, slow, and buggy.
    
- Making advanced configurations (like `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1`, `--force-fp16`, etc.) isn’t possible through the app.
    
- Many compatible models need to be **manually replaced with Apple/CPU/MPS versions** created by third-party developers — if they even exist for your use case.
    

### 💬 Real-World User Struggles

Users frequently hit walls when trying to run ComfyUI smoothly on Mac:

- [Reddit: Faster workflows on Mac](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/1fzrcti/faster_workflows_for_comfyui_users_on_mac_with/)
    
- [GitHub: Mac limitations and open issues](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/issues/4165)

## ✅ The Better Path: Use the Python Web App on a Cloud GPU

Instead of fighting with hardware limitations, a better solution is to run the **ComfyUI Python web app on a cloud-based GPU server**.

You’ll get:

- ⚡ Full CUDA support
    
- 🎛️ Advanced config access
    
- 🚀 Real-time fast performance, even for heavy models
    
- 🌐 Web browser access from your Mac

## 🌐 Cloud GPU Setup Guide

### 1. Pick a Cloud Provider with GPU Support:

Popular services that support hourly GPU rental:

- [🔌 RunPod.io](https://www.runpod.io/)
    
- [⚡ Vast.ai](https://vast.ai/)
    
- [🧠 Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/)
    
- [☁️ Google Cloud / AWS / Azure] (more advanced to manage)
    
- [💻 LambdaLabs](https://lambdalabs.com/)
    
- [🤖 Hugging Face Spaces] (for lighter tasks)

### 2. Option A: Use Prebuilt ComfyUI Templates (No Install Needed)

Some platforms like RunPod or Vast.ai have pre-configured templates:

- Select a **ComfyUI template with GPU** (often labeled "Ready to Use").
    
- Choose a GPU (like A100, 3090, or 4080 depending on your budget).
    
- Click "Deploy" and access ComfyUI via a web URL.
    

#### 🏷️ Pricing Tip:

- You only pay **while the server is running**.
    
- You can **shut it down when not in use** to avoid costs.
    
    - Example: On RunPod or Vast.ai, stopping your instance brings your bill down to near $0/hour.
        
    - Start/stop with one click in your dashboard.
        
- Use **spot/interruptible instances** for lower costs if you don’t need 100% uptime.

### 3. Option B: DIY Install on a Cloud VM

If using a plain Linux server with GPU, here’s what you do:

#### 🔨 Install ComfyUI:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI.git
cd ComfyUI
```

#### 🐍 Install Python & Dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### ⚙️ Install PyTorch with CUDA:

Adjust version for your CUDA version:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

#### 📦 Add Models:

Place your `.safetensors` files in:

- `models/checkpoints/` (main model)
    
- `models/vae/`, `models/clip/`, `models/unet/`, etc.
    

You can use `wget`, `scp`, or upload via Jupyter/WebUI if your provider allows.

#### 🚀 Run ComfyUI:

```bash
python main.py --listen 0.0.0.0 --port 8188
```

Access it via: `http://<server-ip>:8188`

## 🧠 Optional Flags & Tweaks

Use advanced flags like:

```bash
PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1 python3 main.py --force-fp16 --use-split-cross-attention --cpu
```

> Useful for fallback or experimental Apple setups (only works in web app mode — not the Mac app).

## 💸 Cost-Saving Tips Recap

- ✅ **Only pay when the instance is running** — stop it when idle.
    
- ✅ **Use spot/interruptible instances** for lower pricing.
    
- ✅ **Preload models** into attached storage so they don’t re-download.
    
- ✅ **Use lightweight models** when possible.
    
- ✅ **Track GPU vs CPU pricing** and don’t overprovision GPU if your workflow is light.

## 🧩 Final Thoughts

Using ComfyUI from a Mac is completely possible — but trying to do it through the official Mac app will limit you from doing serious work. The Python version on a cloud GPU is the recommended approach, even for casual creators, because:

- You get access to the full ComfyUI ecosystem.
    
- You avoid hardware and compatibility issues.
    
- You can save on costs by starting/stopping on-demand.
