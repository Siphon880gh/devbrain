This general problem of AI Engineering not playing nice on Mac's Apple Silicon chips (eg. M1, M2, M3, etc) extends into ComfyUI running locally as well.

For a general brief of CUDA limitations on AI Engineering, refer to [[CUDA Limitations with AI Engineers on Mac]]

For working with ComfyUI on Mac, it's suggested you choose appropriately. There are several versions of ComfyUI, although the interface are all similar. Refer to [[_Choosing the correct form of ComfyUI - Mac User]] on how to choose the correct ComfyUI based on your needs (including being on Mac).
