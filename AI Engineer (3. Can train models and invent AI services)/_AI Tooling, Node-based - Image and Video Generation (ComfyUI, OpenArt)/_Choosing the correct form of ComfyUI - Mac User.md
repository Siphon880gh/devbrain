There are several forms of ComfyUI, although the interface are all similar. This is why we have a folder called `ComfyUI - _Core (Applies to all platforms)`

## Mac User?

You should **avoid the Mac App**. Although it is officially supported, Comfy.com is a bit misleading. Refer to [[ComfyUI Software - Mac - _Avoid unless you like pain or chance it not working]]

Stick to either **python web app** or a cloud version that allows you to run on a **cloud gpu** that supports nvida cuda. No, you cannot from a **local python web app** switch over to cloud gpu.

But you can run a **cloud python web app** instance like you SSH root access into the terminal. That does require much setup and you do have to keep mindful how to turn on and off the server to prevent unnecessary hourly charges (unless 24 hours-on fits a business use case).

Alternately, **inference platforms** are designed to run tasks on-demand and charge only for the time you use. They significantly reduce setup time by handling many AI engineering dependencies—like PyTorch—for you, and provide you with a web IDE to perform AI Engineering. Even better, services like RunPod and Vast.ai offer **pre-configured ComfyUI templates** labeled "Ready to Use" (These come with all the ComfyUI nodes' dependencies installed and are fully integrated with the server’s CUDA-enabled GPUs).

## Mac User - In more details


You should **avoid the Mac App**. While officially supported, the experience is often frustrating and incomplete. See [[ComfyUI Software - Mac - _Avoid unless you like pain or chance it not working]].

Instead, you have two much better options:

- ✅ Run the **Python web app locally** (with limitations)    
> 🚫 No, you cannot "switch over" your local Python web app to use a cloud GPU. It must be deployed and managed separately.

- ✅ Use a **cloud GPU instance** with ComfyUI (much faster, CUDA-supported)
- ✅ Use a **cloud inference platform** that typically includes Web IDE's (much faster, CUDA-supported)
- ✅ Use a **cloud inference platform that has ComfyUI templates** that (much faster, CUDA-supported)

If you **run a ComfyUI Python server on a remote cloud GPU**—it's as if SSHing into a Linux machine. In fact, it's no different than SSHing into a VPS or Dedicated Service. Your remote cloud GPU just guarantees the server hardware has GPU (Not just CPU). Because you need to SSH in, this requires more technical setup and ongoing management, but it gives you full control and flexibility. An important thing to know how to do is to turn the server off to avoid hourly billing (Similarly to how a Hostinger VPS can just be shut down by the click of a button - the "Stop VPS" button)

Alternatively, minimize the amount of setup with cloud inference platforms. They **make it easy** for AI engineers by giving them a web IDE and are already setup with common AI Engineering dependencies like PyTorch and often have GPU runtimes. And out of those cloud inference platforms, some platforms give you a ready-to-run ComfyUI environment so you don't have to setup the ComfyUI nodes' dependencies.

## 🧠 Summary: Options to Run ComfyUI on Mac (Best to Worst)

|Option|Setup|Performance|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Cloud GPU Rentals (prebuilt ComfyUI)**|🟢 Easy|🟢 Excellent|e.g. RunPod, Vast.ai, Paperspace|
|**Cloud GPU Server (DIY install)**|🟡 Medium|🟢 Excellent|e.g. LambdaLabs, AWS, GCP|
|**Local Python Web App (MPS)**|🟢 Easy|🔴 Poor|CPU/MPS only, limited support|
|**ComfyUI Mac App**|🟢 Easy|🔴 Poor|Avoid|

## 🧨 Why You Should Avoid the Mac App

ComfyUI’s official macOS app is attractive at first—but fails in most real-world use cases:

- ❌ **No NVIDIA/CUDA support** — Apple MPS is underpowered and unstable
- 🔄 **Model compatibility issues** — You'll need to find MPS-compatible versions manually (many don't exist)
- ⚙️ **No CLI access** — Can't set advanced flags or override settings that can increase the compatibility with Mac's Apple MPS.

## ✅ Better Options for Mac Users

### 1. 🔧 **Local Python Web App (DIY on Your Mac)**

- Install ComfyUI from source ([https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI))
- Requires Python 3.10+, Git, and some patience
- Can use Apple MPS backend (`PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1`)

💡 **Best for:** Testing workflows that don’t need GPU acceleration. MPS is a GPU backend for Apple Silicon chip which has integrated GPU but it's still much inferior to Nvidia GPU.

---

### 2. ☁️ **Cloud-Hosted Python Web App (GPU via DIY Cloud Server)**

Provision a Linux VM with GPU support on platforms like:

- 🔹 [Lambda Labs](https://lambdalabs.com/) — Affordable, hourly-billed A100/3090/4090
- 🔹 [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) — p3/p4 instances (pay-as-you-go)
- 🔹 [Google Cloud (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/compute) — GPU VMs with full SSH control
- 🔹 [NVIDIA LaunchPad](https://developer.nvidia.com/launchpad) — Free access with limits
    
Install ComfyUI manually via SSH, and access it through your browser.

💡 **Best for:** Developers who want total control and know how to manage Linux servers.

### 3. ⚡ **Cloud GPU Inference Platforms (Some with Ready-to-Use ComfyUI)**

Cloud inference platforms typically provide both:

- ✅ **GPU runtimes**
- ✅ **Web IDEs** or notebook environments (e.g., Jupyter, VS Code in-browser)
- ✅ Optional persistent volumes and integrations

They’re ideal for **AI engineering tasks**, including model training, fine-tuning, inference, and automation — with ComfyUI being one potential use case.

There are a few main types of Inference Platforms we will talk about below:
- Broad Inference Platforms (General-Purpose AI Dev + Optional ComfyUI)
- ComfyUI-Focused Platforms (Ready-to-Use with 1 Click)
- Bonus: Specialized & Hybrid Platforms (ComfyUI-Compatible or Extendable, Probably **not**  your use case)

#### 🧰 **Broad Inference Platforms (General-Purpose AI Dev + Optional ComfyUI)**

These platforms are great for AI workflows beyond ComfyUI, but some users offer public ComfyUI templates as well:

- 🔹 [**RunPod.io**](https://runpod.io/)
    
    - 🔧 Inference runtime w/ full SSH + volume support
    - 🧠 Web IDE (Jupyter/VS Code style)
    - ✅ Public templates tagged **“ComfyUI – Ready to Use”**
    - 🔁 Auto-shutdown + usage billing
    - ⚡ GPUs: A10, A40, 3090, 4090
        
- 🔹 [**Vast.ai**](https://vast.ai/)
    
    - 🛒 GPU marketplace — choose a provider, region, and image
    - 🐳 Supports Docker containers with **ComfyUI preinstalled**
    - 🔍 Search for `"comfyui"` or `"ready to use"` images
    - ⚙️ Full SSH/web GUI access depending on container

- 🔹 [**Paperspace (Gradient)**](https://www.paperspace.com/)
    
    - ☁️ Offers notebook-based GPU runtimes
    - 📦 Community-contributed ComfyUI containers exist
    - 🗂 Persistent storage, good for long-term experiments
    - ❗ Slightly higher setup time compared to RunPod/Vast
    
- 🔹 [**Hugging Face Spaces**](https://huggingface.co/spaces)
    
    - 🎛️ Web interface to host AI demos (UI + backend in one)
    - 🧪 Limited GPU (T4s) with time restrictions
    - 🧩 ComfyUI clones available as Spaces (search `"comfyui"`)
    - 🐢 Performance can be slow; not production-ready

#### ✅ **ComfyUI-Focused Platforms (Ready-to-Use with 1 Click)**

These are the **best choices** if your **only goal is to run ComfyUI workflows** with minimal setup:

- 🟢 **RunPod.io**
    
    - Best balance of ease, speed, and GPU selection
    - Has official and community ComfyUI templates
    - Launch in minutes with minimal terminal use
        
- 🟢 **Vast.ai**
    - Very low cost and flexible
    - Slightly more technical: container config matters
    - Excellent for experimenting at scale

💡 **Best for:** Users who want high-performance ComfyUI rendering without managing Python environments, dependencies, or GPU drivers.

#### 🧩 **Specialized & Hybrid Platforms (ComfyUI-Compatible or Extendable, Probably not your use case)**

Some platforms don’t fall squarely into the above categories but are worth highlighting for their powerful features:

- 🔹 [**Beam**](https://beam.cloud/) – A Python-native app deployment platform that supports ComfyUI via Docker or Python-based deployment. Great for autoscaling and backend integration.
    
- 🔹 [**ThinkDiffusion**](https://thinkdiffusion.com/) – Fully managed ComfyUI and Stable Diffusion platform. Perfect for non-coders or creators who want no-setup rendering.
    
- 🔹 [**BentoML**](https://bentoml.com/) – A model-serving MLOps tool for deploying AI models (including ComfyUI workflows) with REST APIs, ideal for enterprise and backend devs.
