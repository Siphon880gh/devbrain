AI model names with suffixes like `-q4_0` or `7B` convey important details about the model's architecture, size, and quantization level. Here's what they typically mean:

### 1. **Model Size: "7B", "13B", etc.**

- These refer to the number of **parameters** (weights) in the model.
- Example:
    - **"7B"** means **7 billion parameters**.
    - **"13B"** means **13 billion parameters**.
- Larger models generally have more capabilities but require more computational resources.

### 2. **Quantization: "-q4_0", "-q5_1", etc.**

- This refers to how the model weights are stored and computed, affecting model size and performance.
- Common quantization formats include:
    - **"q4_0"** → 4-bit quantization, version 0
    - **"q5_1"** → 5-bit quantization, version 1
- Lower-bit quantization reduces memory usage and speeds up inference but can reduce model accuracy.

### Example: `LLaMA-7B-q4_0`

- **LLaMA** → Model name (e.g., Meta's LLaMA model)
- **7B** → 7 billion parameters
- **q4_0** → 4-bit quantization (variant 0)

This means it's a LLaMA model with 7 billion parameters, optimized for efficiency using 4-bit quantization.
