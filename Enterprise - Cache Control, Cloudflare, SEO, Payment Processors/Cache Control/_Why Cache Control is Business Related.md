If you are constantly changing the app especially in the early stages, you want the user to be able to see the latest changes. With [[Cache busting from client side (You are the client)]] where the user manually clears the cache, it requires some tech savyness. You want to bust the cache for your user without them having to think about it. Asking them to clear the cache in a message is not that user friendly. 

And more problematic, if certain assets are cached and certain ones arenâ€™t, then your webpage or web app may bug out, damaging your reputation.

Once your app changes are more stable, you may switch over to long-term caching for a performance boost.
