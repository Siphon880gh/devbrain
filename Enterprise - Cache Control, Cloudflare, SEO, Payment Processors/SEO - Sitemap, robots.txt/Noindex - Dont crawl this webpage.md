The `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` tag tells search engines not to index the page on which it appears.

If you place this tag on a page of your website, search engines like Google that respect the robots meta tag will eventually remove that page from their indexes the next time they crawl it.

However, just adding the tag doesn't guarantee immediate removal. Google and other search engines will need to recrawl the page to see the tag. Once they see it, they'll begin the process of de-indexing the page.

**✋ GOTCHA** - The google crawler has to "see" the tag. Check `robots.txt` settings:
    - If you’ve disallowed the page in `robots.txt`, **temporarily allow crawling**.
    - Otherwise, search engines won't be able to see the `noindex` tag and won’t remove the page.

If **you want to ensure its removal as quickly as possible** after adding the `noindex` tag:

1. **Use Google Search Console (GSC)**:
    - Use the **“Inspect any URL”** tool in GSC to check the page.
    - Click **“Request Indexing”** after the inspection finishes. This notifies Google of the update and may trigger a faster recrawl.
        
2. **URL Removal Tool in GSC**:
    - For temporary removal from search results, use the **URL Removal Tool** to hide the page while waiting for the `noindex` tag to take effect.
    - Note: This only hides the page temporarily (~6 months), and it still needs the `noindex` tag to be removed permanently.
        
3. **Submit a Sitemap**:
    - If the page is listed in your XML sitemap, resubmitting the sitemap in GSC can encourage a fresh crawl of all listed URLs.

### ⚠️ Reminder

Removing a page from Google's index means users won’t be able to find it via Google Search. If you only want to **temporarily hide** the page, you can remove the `noindex` tag later to allow re-indexing. You can request Google to re-index using the above steps as well.
