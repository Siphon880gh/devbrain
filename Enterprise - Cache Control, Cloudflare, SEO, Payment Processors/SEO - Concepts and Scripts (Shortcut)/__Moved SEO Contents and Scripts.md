SEO Concepts really belong to my business notes. And because I have scripts like for Hubspot at business notes, the SEO scripts (such as blog generation) are there as well.

The intention of the SEO folders at my Developer Brain is to cover the basics. Going beyond that usually involves a SEO expert instead of burdening your developer, so those notes belong to the business notes.
