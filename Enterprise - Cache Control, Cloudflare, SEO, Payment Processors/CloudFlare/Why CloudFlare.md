Many companies take advantage of Cloudflare’s free features, including SSL certificates, basic DDoS protection, IP blocking, and human verification (to prevent automated bots from scraping your content). Larger businesses often upgrade to paid plans to gain access to regional caching, though basic caching is available on both free and paid tiers.

If you're on the **Pro Plan**, Cloudflare’s **Polish** feature can automatically optimize and compress your images. This reduces image file sizes, decreases bandwidth usage, and improves page load speed. You can choose between **lossless** or **lossy** compression depending on your quality and performance needs.

Additionally, Cloudflare maintains a reputation system for IP addresses. If an IP has already been verified on another Cloudflare-protected site, that trust can carry over, helping streamline access across different websites. This system helps detect suspicious behavior like VPN usage or IP rotation often associated with malicious activity.
