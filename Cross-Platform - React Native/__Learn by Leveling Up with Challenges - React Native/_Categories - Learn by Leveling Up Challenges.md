This type of learning is you going through all the tutorials and challenges in the order they're presented. Usually they go from easiest to increasing difficulty.

These challenges assumed you followed the primer guide so you understand the concepts of fundamentals of React Native: 
[[_PRIMER - React Native - Concepts]]

This set also assumed you’ve installed React Native and have an ability to preview code changes on all devices whether virtual or physical, including PC:
[[_PRIMER - React Native - Setup and Code Changes]]

Checkpoint so far: It has created a react native starter code app. I haven’t done any complicated layouts or routing yet. I plan to take the challenges of these create mini apps. Through these challenges I am willing to learn the fundamentals of React Native.

Specifically, this set will walk you through basic layouts (including common components), then interaction and ui, then navigation (stack, routes), then data flow between screens and across the internet. Routes include name based routes, url only rounds, and file-url routes.
