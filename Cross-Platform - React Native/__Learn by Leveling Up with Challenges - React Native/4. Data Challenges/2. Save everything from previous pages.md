Challenge: Create a user survey that is one question per screen (Did they like the app? How can we improve the app? Is this an app they share with friends). They can click yes or no buttons

On the final screen, say "Thanks for answering the survey. Here is your responses recorded:"

Using useContext, you've been saving each screen's user response. At the final screen, you use useContext to recall the previous screens' responses and display them back to the user.

Hint: Refer to [[React Native State Management - useContext]].

DO NOT: Do not show screens using only one screen (conditional rendering). We want to see if we can save user input from the entire app across different screens.
