Deploying an Expo app to the Apple App Store and Google Play involves several steps. Here's an overview of how you can do this:

### 1. **Prepare Your App for Production**
   Before deploying, make sure your app is ready for production:
   - Update your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file with important details like `name`, `slug`, `version`, and other metadata.
   - Optimize your assets by using `expo-optimize` and removing unnecessary files.
   - Ensure all dependencies are production-ready and that your app works well in a standalone environment.

### 2. **Build the App**
   Expo provides an easy way to build production-ready binaries for both Android and iOS.
   - **Build for iOS**:
     ```bash
     expo build:ios
     ```
     - Expo will prompt you for your Apple credentials and handle certificate generation. It will then generate a `.ipa` file, which is the binary file for iOS.
   - **Build for Android**:
     ```bash
     expo build:android
     ```
     - Expo will generate an `.apk` or `.aab` file, which is the binary file for Android. For Google Play, it's recommended to use an `.aab` file.

### 3. **Submit to Google Play**
   - After building the Android `.aab` file, follow these steps:
     1. Log in to your [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/).
     2. Create a new app and follow the prompts to fill out app information (title, description, icon, etc.).
     3. Upload the `.aab` file generated by Expo.
     4. Complete the necessary app review requirements (content rating, app privacy policy, etc.).
     5. Submit your app for review.

### 4. **Submit to the Apple App Store**
   - After building the iOS `.ipa` file, use Expo’s `eas submit` or Apple's Transporter tool to upload your app:
     1. **Using Expo EAS Submit**:
        ```bash
        eas submit -p ios
        ```
     2. **Using Apple's Transporter App**:
        - Download and install the Transporter app from the Mac App Store.
        - Upload the `.ipa` file to your App Store Connect account.
   
   - In [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/), you'll need to:
     1. Fill out the necessary app information, including screenshots, app description, privacy policy, and app metadata.
     2. Set up app pricing, categories, and other metadata.
     3. Submit your app for review.

### 5. **Review Process**
   - Both Apple and Google will review your app to ensure it complies with their store guidelines. This process can take a few days, especially for the Apple App Store.
   - If any issues are found, you’ll receive feedback to make corrections and resubmit.

### Additional Tips:
- **Expo EAS (Expo Application Services)**: If you are looking for more flexibility (e.g., custom native code), you can use Expo’s EAS services to build and submit your app. Expo’s managed workflow makes it easier to deploy apps, but EAS allows for more customization.

This process will help you get your Expo app onto both app stores for distribution.
