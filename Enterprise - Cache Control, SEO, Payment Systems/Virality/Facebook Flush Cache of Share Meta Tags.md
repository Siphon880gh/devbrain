Aka: Facebook's Share Debugger
https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/

Facebook often caches Open Graph (`og:title`, `og:url`, etc.) metadata for URLs, which means it may not refresh the title and other metadata whenever you makes changes to it (Eg. Marketing team wants the description to change when users share your link)

You plug in your url at the Facebook Share Debugger to tell it to update their cache.
