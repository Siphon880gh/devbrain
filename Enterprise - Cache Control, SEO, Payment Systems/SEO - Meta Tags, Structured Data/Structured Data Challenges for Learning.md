Below are a list of challenges so you can learn Data Structures for Google search results more intimately.

A suggested workflow is to:
- Select a challenge
- Use ChatGPT to generate a mock webpage with tailwind. 
- Then build out the data structure following documentation on supported Schema types based on your webpage type at [[Structured Data Documentation - Supported Schema Types]]. 
- And validate your structured data syntax using [[Structured Data - Validation Tools]]
