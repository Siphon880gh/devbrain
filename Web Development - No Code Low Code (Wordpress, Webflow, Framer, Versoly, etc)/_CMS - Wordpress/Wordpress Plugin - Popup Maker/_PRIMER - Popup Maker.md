## Other Triggers

Besides button triggers, you have the other possible triggers: [[Popup Maker - Free vs Paid Triggers]]

If a visitor opens a pop-up, it should always work. Pop-ups that interrupt the flow should appear only once per session, then not again for a good while, so they don’t feel pushy.

At Triggers panel, notice there's a Cookies control section:

You can have finer control choosing Manual:
- For example, dont show popup again for 1 month after user has seen the popup.
