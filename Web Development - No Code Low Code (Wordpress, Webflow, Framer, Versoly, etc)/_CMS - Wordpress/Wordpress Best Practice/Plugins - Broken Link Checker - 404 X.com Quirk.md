Regarding plugin: Broken Link Checker by WPMU DEV, in Local mode

twitter.com links are reported broken because redirects are usually reported broken
so you change it to x.com

It may still report broken.. it's a quirk they may fix in a later update.

You could add x.com to the exclusion link, but that's at your own risk of 404's affecting your SEO (if someone's X.com profile shuts down or they shut down their profile):

Or you could exclude that particular x.com profile link, but same risk if that X.com profile shuts down or they shut down their profile:
