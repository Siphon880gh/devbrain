Regarding plugin: Redirections by John Godley

It can log users hitting links that 404. It **does not** scan webpages for 404 links. Refer to [[Plugins - _Wordpress Must-Have Plugins]] for such plugin.

Make sure to turn on logs because by default it's been set to "No Logs". A good option is "A week" or "A month" depending on how active you are attending to this log:

Then it can properly show visited 404 links (Here I directly visited domain.com/test-broken-link):
