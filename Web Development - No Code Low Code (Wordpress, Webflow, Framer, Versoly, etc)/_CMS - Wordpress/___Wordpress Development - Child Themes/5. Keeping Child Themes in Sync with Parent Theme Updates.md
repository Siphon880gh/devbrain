Titled: Keeping Child Themes in Sync with Parent Theme Updates

“Syncing” doesn’t mean automatic merging. It means **manual awareness**.

### Why things break

When you copy a template into a child theme, you freeze it in time.

If the parent later:

- Fixes a bug
    
- Changes markup
    
- Adds new hooks
    

Your child version will **not** receive those changes.

### How to detect issues

After a parent update:

1. Check which templates you’ve overridden
    
2. Compare them against the updated parent files
    

Use:

- Git diffs
    
- Beyond Compare / Meld / WinMerge
    
- Parent theme changelogs (if available)
    

### How to update safely

- Copy only the relevant changes from parent → child
    
- Keep your custom logic intact
    
- Test layouts and WooCommerce templates carefully
    

### How to avoid this long-term

- Prefer hooks & filters over full template copies
    
- Override templates only when markup control is necessary
    
- Don’t skip multiple parent updates—differences compound
    

### Practical workflow

1. Update parent theme
    
2. Site looks fine → done
    
3. Something breaks → check overridden templates first
    
4. Diff → merge → test

## Final Quick Reference (Developer Checklist)

- `style.css` header registers the theme
    
- `Template:` links child → parent
    
- `screenshot.png` is cosmetic only
    
- Child templates override parent by filename + path
    
- `functions.php` runs in both parent and child
    
- CSS must be explicitly enqueued
    
- Parent updates never overwrite child files—but may invalidate them

If you want, next logical follow-ups would be:

- **Child themes vs block themes (theme.json mental model)**
    
- **Child themes vs mu-plugins for developers**
    
- **When NOT to use a child theme (Elementor-only builds)**
