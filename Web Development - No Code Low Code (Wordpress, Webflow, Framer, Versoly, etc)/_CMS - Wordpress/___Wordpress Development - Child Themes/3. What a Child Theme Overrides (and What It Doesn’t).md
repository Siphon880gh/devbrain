Child themes are **overlay systems**, not forks.

### Templates (override by path + filename)

If a file exists in both parent and child at the same path, the child wins.

Example:

```
parent-theme/single.php
child-theme/single.php
```

WordPress loads the child version.

This applies to deep paths too:

```
template-parts/header.php
```

### functions.php (both run)

This trips up developers coming from other ecosystems.

- Parent `functions.php` runs
    
- Child `functions.php` runs **first**
    
- You do **not** replace the parent’s file
    

Use hooks and filters to modify behavior instead of copying parent functions.

Bad pattern:

- Copying large parent functions into the child
    

Good pattern:

- Adding filters, actions, or small helpers in the child
    

### Styles (depends on enqueueing)

CSS behavior depends entirely on how the parent theme loads styles.

- Many themes load both parent + child automatically
    
- Some (like Hello Elementor) **do not**
    

If your CSS “isn’t loading,” it’s almost always an enqueue issue—not WordPress.
