# WordPress Child Themes: What Actually Makes a Theme a Theme

**TL;DR**

- `style.css` with a valid header comment is what registers a theme in WordPress.
- `Template:` inside that header is what links a child theme to its parent.
- `screenshot.png` only affects the thumbnail in the admin UI.

WordPress does **not** discover themes via PHP, JSON, or config files.  
It scans folders inside:

```
/wp-content/themes/
```

And looks specifically for a `style.css` file with a valid header comment.

Example (minimum viable header):

```css
/*
 Theme Name: My Theme Child
 Template:   parent-theme-folder
*/
```

Two critical points developers often miss:

- **Theme Name** can be anything.
    
- **Template must match the parent theme’s folder name exactly**, not the display name.
    

If that header exists, WordPress treats the folder as a theme. Nothing else is required.

`screenshot.png` (recommended size: 1200×900) only controls the visual preview in  
**Appearance → Themes**. It has no functional impact.
