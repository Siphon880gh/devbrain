In both **Salient’s WPBakery builder** and the **official WPBakery Page Builder**, you can assign a custom **ID** or **class** to any **row**:

Once you've done that, you can use the **page-level CSS editor** to style:
- That specific row using its ID or class.
- Any **column or element inside** that row by using a **descendant selector**.

To target a specific part of the row more precisely (a column or a specific element), you can use:
- A **unique class**,
- A **unique combination of classes**,
- A **specific attribute**, or
- A **key/value attribute pair**
- If the element or column already has an ID and you want to use it for styling, make sure it’s not auto-generated by the theme or builder. If you didn’t assign the ID yourself, it may change between page refreshes or when the content is re-published or when you add new elements to the page—making your CSS unreliable. **Auto-generated IDs** often include random strings or numeric counters (e.g., `#vc_row-63c8f4`).
