Naming: Site builder and page builders will be synonymous.

## Salient
![](dmtQ5C2.png)

Salient theme has a couple site builders and site building features
- Salient theme bundled in WP Bakery and enhanced it with additional custom elements, styles, and animations, making it more visually appealing and tailored for creative websites. This integration allows users to enjoy WPBakery's drag-and-drop functionality while benefiting from Salientâ€™s unique design options and pre-built layouts.
- Many of these custom styles tightly lock you into their own system. 
- With WPBakery, you have an enhanced Backend Editor, Frontend Editor, and Classic Editor (aka Code Editor).
- Nectar shortcodes button that opens a library of elements and layouts, then selecting a nectar shortcode opens a wizard of options to configure, and when finalized, inserts a shortcode. This is accessible in the Classic Editor (aka Code Editor) of the enhanced WP Bakery.

## WPBakery (Formerly Visual Composer)
- Work with any theme. Does NOT lock you in.
- Has Backend Editor and Frontend Editor described here https://wpbakery.com/features/wordpress-editor/. 
- Btw, WPBakery was formerly known as Visual Composer but had to change their names for legal reasons - and which is why shortcodes in the Classic Editor are preceded "vc_"
- The Classic Editor is the Code Editor from Gutenberg reskinned. Easy and intuitive to use. Longer update cycles. WPBakery promises to work with any theme because it's not locked into their own system. As of 10/2024, it's $69 for lifetime at https://wpbakery.com/features/work-with-any-wordpress-theme/
## Elementor

This site builder is installed from plugins instead of themes. It locks you somewhat into their own system. Elementor has less design-ready elements than Salient, but Elementor gives you more control over the design (their design options are more comprehensive). Elementor has shorter update cycles so it can leverage any new web technologies and protect against exploits, but their updates often break the PHP website. There are also online complaints that Elementor has moved free features to the paid version willy nilly.

## Nectarblock

Nectarblock theme that includes the Nectarblock site editor. Enhances the Appearance editor. and is built on top of the Gutenberg Editor From the same people of Salient, this newer product line promises high quality websites, producing websites similar to Apple.com with scroll triggered effects and visual touches to elements and layouts that are industry trending.

## Gutenberg
Default wordpress' site builder. It's considered dated.

## Salient vs Elementor

While both Salient and Elementor locks you into their site builder, they do so in various degrees. Compared to Elementor, Salient has many more designed elements and layouts that will not work correctly if switching over to another site builder.

With ready-made designs and thorough control of design, there is a compromise between the two site builders. Salient has more ready-made designs but gives you less control over the design. Elementor has less ready-made designs but gives you complete control of the design. Depending on how customized your website needs to be, you could choose Salient or Elementor. But don't forget with Elementor, the website often crashes when its theme updates or when Wordpress updates.
