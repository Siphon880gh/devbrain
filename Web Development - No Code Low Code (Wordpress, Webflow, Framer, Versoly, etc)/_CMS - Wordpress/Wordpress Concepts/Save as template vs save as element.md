Titled: Save as template vs save as element

TLDR:  
Row → Template
Block → Element

---

Row settings allow you to save the row as template:
Pencil on the row → Gear on the row settings modal → Save as template

Block's Edit (only appears on hovering mouse) is saving elements:
Edit on text content etc (Pencil appears on hovering) → Gear icon on that element's modal → Gear icon → Save as element
