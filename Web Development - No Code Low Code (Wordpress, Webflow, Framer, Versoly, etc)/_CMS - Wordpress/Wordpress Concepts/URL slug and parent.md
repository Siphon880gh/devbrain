Right side editing a page is how you determine the parent path in the URL:
![[Pasted image 20250721055855.png]]

Notice the parent is "Memberships", so the URL becomes:
[domain.com/memberships/YOUR_SLUG](https://domain.com/memberships/YOUR_SLUG "https://domain.com/memberships/YOUR_SLUG")

You can modify the slug at the `permalink` section which is above the builder modes:
![[Pasted image 20250721055943.png]]

Then the URL becomes:
domain.com/memberships/premiere
