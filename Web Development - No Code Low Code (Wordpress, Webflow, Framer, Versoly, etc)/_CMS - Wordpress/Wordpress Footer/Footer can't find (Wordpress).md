Appearance → Customize → Widgets → Can't find headers or footer?

Look up your theme on chatgpt on how to access footer or header. The theme has reshuffled some stuff! Eg. Wordpress Salient/Impeka edit footer (at youtube). Impeka not as popular so you may have to ask chat instead of youtube to find anything.
