After uploading to the media library, you can usually select it to display in your picture or video blocks/elements.

If you have too many images, you may want to remember the **image filename** so you can search for it when selecting an image at a block/element

However, if you need to code it, then you'll need the **asset's URL**.

Had inspected for the image name or gotten the full url from browsing the media library
