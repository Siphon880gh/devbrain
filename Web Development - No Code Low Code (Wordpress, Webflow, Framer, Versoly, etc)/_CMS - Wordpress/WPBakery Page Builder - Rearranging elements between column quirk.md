Usually you can rearrange very easily:

But sometimes, the drop zone does not appear:

Two ways:
- Jiggle the mouse around, in and out at different corners of where the drop zone would be
- Create a temporary text block so that there's another element. This will allow a dropzone to appear when dragging to between the final two blocks (the real block and the temporary block). After you're done moving a block successfully between them, delete the temporary block
