Blocksy theme:

---

The WordPress Blocksy theme features a user-friendly site builder. The **left panel outlines the layout of the webpage**, listing specific block types by name, while the **right panel provides an instant preview**, jumping to the corresponding section. Adjusting sizes and layouts is fast, with changes rendering almost immediately.

**However**, a major drawback is its dependency on **Elementor Pro**, which is known to crash frequentlyâ€”especially after PHP or plugin updates.
