Lets you replace strings in database. Make sure to backup your database first! Free.

Access at:
- Tools â†’ Better Search Replace. 

Start replacing strings in the database with some caveats:
- Make sure DRY RUN is DISABLED (It likes to keep toggling back on whenever you perform a new search and replace)..
- Make sure to select all the tables. Otherwise if no table selected, it'll just say no matches!

Search and replace like you had planned.

Bad because you forgot to turn off DRY RUN (remember it likes to toggle back on for each new search):

Good because it replaced text!
