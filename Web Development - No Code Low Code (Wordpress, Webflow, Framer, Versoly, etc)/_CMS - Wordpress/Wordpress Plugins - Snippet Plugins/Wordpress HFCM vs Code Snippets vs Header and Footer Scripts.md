## Code Snippets by Code Snippets Pro

https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/

Displays a list of available snippets, indicating whether each one is shortcode-only (tagged as `content`), or automatically applied to all pages in the header or footer (tagged as `head-content` or `footer-content`). Shortcodes can only be viewed and copied from within the snippet’s edit screen.

In the screenshot, _Custom Video Player_ is available only through shortcode insertion. _GTag Head_ adds code to every page’s `<head>` section, while _GTag Tail_ inserts code right before the closing `</body>` tag.

When editing a snippet, you can choose shortcode, head block, or body tag closing:

When you choose shortcode insertion, the shortcode will be displayed so you can copy and paste it into any webpage.
