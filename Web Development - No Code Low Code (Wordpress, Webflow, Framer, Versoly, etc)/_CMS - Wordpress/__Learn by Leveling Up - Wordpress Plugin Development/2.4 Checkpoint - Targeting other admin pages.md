We've been making the plugin Hello Dolly apply onto to editing page. Here are other possible admin pages you can target using `get_current_screen()` if operator:

- **Edit a post/page**: `$screen->base === 'post'` (and `$screen->post_type === 'page'` for pages)
- **Add new post/page**: `$screen->base === 'post-new'` (older installs may report `'post'`; the `in_array()` above covers both)
- **All Pages list**: `$screen->id === 'edit-page'`
- **Dashboard**: `$screen->id === 'dashboard'`

Note that there's a distinction between editing a page and adding a page
