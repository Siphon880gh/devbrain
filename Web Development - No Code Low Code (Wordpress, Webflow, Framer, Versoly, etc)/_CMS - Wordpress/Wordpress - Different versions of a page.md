You’d duplicate a page. But as for the header, having different headers for different versions of the website is tricky. You only have one header for the entire website, so you’d have to hide the header then create another block imitating a new header on the different page. 

Eg. His client does photography for rockstars and also for wedding, but it’d confuse the clients if the website has both sets of photos so he gives a different link depending if showing only rockstar photos or showing only wedding photos
