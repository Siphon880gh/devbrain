Let's say you want a free caching plugin that is easy to install and setup, and you are not on a LiteSpeed server:

- **For easiest setup and solid results**: Go with **WP Rocket**.
- ~~**If your host supports it and you’re okay configuring**: **LiteSpeed Cache** offers top performance for free.~~
- ~~^ LiteSpeed Cache requires a LiteSpeed web server to function properly for its server-level caching features. SiteGround uses Nginx servers, not LiteSpeed servers ~~
- ~~**For fine-grained control in addition to caching**: Layer **Perfmatters** with WP Rocket or LiteSpeed. PAID VERSION~~
- ~~**Want top-tier, performance-first results and advanced features?** Try **FlyingPress**. Not able to install in Wordpress Plugins Store as of Aug 2025, requiring you to install by uploading plugin folder manually.~~
- ~~**Hosted on SiteGround?** Start with **SG Optimizer**, and add Perfmatters if needed. PAID VERSION~~
- ~~**Want an all-automated solution?** Consider **NitroPack**, but **test for real load time, not just scores**. PAID VERSION to get rid of footer badge~~
