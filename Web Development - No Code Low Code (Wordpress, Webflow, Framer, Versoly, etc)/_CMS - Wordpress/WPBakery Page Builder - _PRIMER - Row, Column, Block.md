## Rows

Here all the rows are collapsed except one:
![[Pasted image 20250723054755.png]]
- ðŸ‘€ A row is associated with having rearrange, column grids, and add buttons on the top left of the row and collapse/pencil/duplicate/delete buttons at the top right.
- Note that a WPBakery row can have lines of columns if the columns wrap over (more on this in the next section)

You **a**dd a **r**ow by pressing:

Row settings can notably allow you to:
- Add background image to the entire section on the webpage
- Add spacing above/below the row
- Row can let you set the grid layout of the columns

## Columns

Add an empty column by pressing the Plus at the row:
![[Pasted image 20250723065426.png]]

Here is an empty column that's wrapped to the next line in the same row. It's NOT a new row:
![[Pasted image 20250723053816.png]]
- ðŸ‘€ A rectangular area that doesn't have the collapse/pencil/duplicate/delete buttons nearby means it's a column that wrapped over to the next line or that it's just a column belonging in a row. 
- ðŸ‘€ Wrapped over columns belong to the same row. But the row is not designed to look like a gray container of all the columns (notice a white gap between "Get Your Package Now" column and the empty wrapped column below it)
- More info at: [[WPBakery Page Builder - Row Can Wrap Columns]]

To edit the settings of a column, you click the pencil icon that's NOT associated with a row:
![[Pasted image 20250723065641.png]]
- Note you are not clicking the cancel at the top right, which is associated with the row
- ðŸ‘€ The pencil icon of a column is always at the center of some rectangular area

## Block aka Element

Going back to this screenshot:
![[Pasted image 20250723053816.png]]
- There is a text block in column 1. It has CSS Animation and its text is "Get Your Package Now!"
- Column 2 is empty, carrying no blocks. It has a plus symbol for you to add a block directly inside the column
- This modal appears. Note if you choose to add a Row, it'll add a row to the bottom of the site builder. Otherwise choosing another element or block will fill in that empty column.

  Or if it's an empty column that's not the final column:
  
You can edit a block only if you hover your mouse over the block, and edit option appears
- Mouse not hovered:

- Mouse hovered:

## Assigning class and IDs for styling

Only works for rows or columns, but not elements/blocks.
