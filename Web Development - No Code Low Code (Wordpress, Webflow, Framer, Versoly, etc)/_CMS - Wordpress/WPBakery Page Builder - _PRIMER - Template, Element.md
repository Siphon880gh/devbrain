## Row Template

You can save a **row as a template** inside Row Settings:

You can load a saved template at the top left of the WPBakery Page Builder:

Zoomed out, the top of the WPBakery Page Builder is:

Btw, that's also where you can undo or redo changes to the website layout from adding row/column/elements.

## Column Element

Although it appears you can save the column as an **element** which is basically a template, it could be quirky and not worth it for your theme (go test it). For sure it's not compatible with Impeka theme (tested loading in the column element from the Builder add button, tested loading it in from the row's add button, and tested loading in from a column's add button).

In the element settings, for example, here for the column called `_Saved_Column`:

Let's say you saved it as `_Saved_Column`, then you can add the same column when at the "Add Element" modal. You're adding element -> "My elements" or searching the element name directly:

If your theme is incompatible with column elements, the builder will look glitchy:

## Block Element

You can save the block/element as an **Element** which is basically a template. In the element settings, for example, here for the block called Button Group:
![[Pasted image 20250727184403.png]]

Let's say you saved it as `_Stacked_Buttons`, then you can add the same element settings/content at another column when at the "Add Element" modal. You're adding element -> "My elements" or searching the element name directly:

## Assigning class and IDs for styling

Only works for rows or columns, but not elements/blocks.
