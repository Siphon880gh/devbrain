Rationales:
- Visual composer 100% not free
- Elementor free but a lot of things like custom css are upgrade only
- Adding Classic Editor you can switch between Elementor site builder and the Classic Editor site builder without compatibility issues.
- Wordpress does not automatically include Classic Editor, so you have to go download it (hence listed here as a must-have)
- But the Classic Editor is important because other plugins that make custom css possible show up in that Classic Editor site builder's interface.

Get/install:
- Classic Editor
- Header and footer scripts
