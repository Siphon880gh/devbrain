After finishing page editing a page and hitting Publish (or you're re-publishing):
- Always clear cache on the right and at the top strip. Because if there's different layers of cache, it may appear broken to other people but not to you. Note you may not have these cache clearing options, depending on your Wordpress setup:
	- On the right, above the Trash action (WP Rocket):

	- At the top admin strip (If WP Rocket, Siteground, etc):
	  ![[Pasted image 20250723053008.png]]
- Also view the webpages you've done in incognito. Some website layout breaking errors dont show up if you're logged in
- Finally, view the website on mobile too.
