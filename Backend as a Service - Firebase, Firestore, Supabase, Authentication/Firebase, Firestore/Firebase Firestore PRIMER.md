Aka Get Started
By Weng

1. Decide if you want Firebase or Firestore: [[Firebase vs Firestore]]. This tutorial is for firebase.

2. Setup owners in your team by email invitations:
   Settings (Gear icon) -> Users and permission
   
   You can do this now or later.

3. Add your app
   Project Overview (Home icon) -> Get started by adding Firebase to your app -> Select Platform. 
   
   Name your app and follow instructions on adding the Firebase SDK.

> [!note] If for example npm, but you should follow their latest instructions
> Install with: `npm install firebase`
> 
> Script:
> ````
> // Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
> import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
> import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics";
> // TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
> // https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries
> 
> // Your web app's Firebase configuration
> // For Firebase JS SDK v7.20.0 and later, measurementId is optional
> const firebaseConfig = {
>  apiKey: "AIzaSyDZw6OtSZIzRztMVm6XvEgGK3czz133I3M",
>  authDomain: "mixoreact.firebaseapp.com",
>  projectId: "mixoreact",
>  storageBucket: "mixoreact.appspot.com",
>  messagingSenderId: "110980428490",
>  appId: "1:110980428490:web:8280bfeec1fdff8dbcba33",
>  measurementId: "G-S44MT5P2Q5"
> };
> 
> // Initialize Firebase
> const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
> const analytics = getAnalytics(app);
> ```


4. Choose Firestore:
   All products (grid icon) -> Cloud Firestore -> Create Database
   When asked on Security Rules, choose "Start in test mode", which will give you these security rules:
   
```
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "now < 1728630000000",  // 2024-10-11
    ".write": "now < 1728630000000",  // 2024-10-11
  }
}
```

	These timestamps are calculated to be 30 days ahead. After those dates, your data is inaccessible (neither read or write)
	
We will change these rules soon.

Decide on security rules and setup security rules (otherwise Google will keep emailing you about your security rules being too laxed)
