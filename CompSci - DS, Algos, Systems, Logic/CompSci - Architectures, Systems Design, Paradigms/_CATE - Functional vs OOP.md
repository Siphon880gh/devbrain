Functional programming emphasizes immutable data, first-class functions, higher-order functions, and pure functions. Techniques like currying and concepts such as referential transparency are central to FP. These ideas help developers write code that's more predictable, easier to test, and often easier to reason about.

OOP design patterns provide templated solutions to common design issues, making the code more modular, reusable, and adaptable. Patterns like Singleton, Observer, Strategy, and Factory address specific design challenges, facilitating more manageable and scalable code organization.


While design patterns are traditionally describing OOP with classes, when it comes to functional programming there is no vocabulary like "design patterns" and instead it's relegated as techniques and concepts. However, they're both at the same level semantically speaking.
