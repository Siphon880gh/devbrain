## Design Patterns?


The term "design patterns" can apply to both database design and software design (to keep in simplistic terms, because design patterns also refer to large data warehouses for big query, etc), but they refer to conventions in their respective domains.

**Database Design Patterns** refer to the best practices for structuring databases. This includes how to organize tables, relationships, and data retrieval methods to ensure data integrity, performance, and scalability. Patterns like Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV), Table-per-Type (TPT), and Single Table Inheritance are specific to how data can be organized within a database.

**Software Design Patterns**, on the other hand, are more about object-oriented design and are commonly used in the context of views, controllers, models, classes, etc. These patterns help solve common software design problems and include:

1. **Creational Patterns**: Such as Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype. These are related to how objects are created.

2. **Structural Patterns**: Such as Adapter, Composite, Proxy, Flyweight, Facade, Bridge, and Decorator. These deal with the composition of classes and objects.

3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Such as Strategy, Observer, Command, Iterator, Mediator, State, and Visitor. These deal with communication between objects.

4. **Architectural Patterns**: Such as MVC (Model-View-Controller), MVP (Model-View-Presenter), and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel). These are higher-level patterns that detail how entire applications or systems should be structured.

Each type of pattern serves a different purpose and applies to different aspects of software development. The principles behind these patterns are often documented in books like "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides (commonly known as the "Gang of Four") for software design patterns, and in various database design and architecture books for database design patterns.

## Types of Patterns

There are software design patterns, database design patterns, database access patterns, data warehouse patterns, and architecture patterns, and enterprise patterns?


Yes, that's correct. Here's a brief overview of each:

1. **Software Design Patterns:** These are general repeatable solutions to common problems in software design. They are best practices formalized after a considerable period of trial and error, and they serve as templates that help software developers solve problems in software design. Examples include Singleton, Factory, Strategy, and Observer patterns.

2. **Database Design Patterns:** These patterns pertain specifically to the design of database schemas. They help solve common problems such as how to represent hierarchies, handle large binary objects, and manage changes in database structure. Examples include the Active Record, Data Mapper, and Repository patterns.
   
3. **Database Access Patterns**: The typical ways in which data is retrieved from or stored in a database. These patterns are an essential consideration in database design, as they affect performance, scalability, and maintainability of data storage solutions. 

4. **Data Warehouse Patterns:** These are design patterns used in the construction of data warehouses. They provide solutions for organizing data to support business intelligence and analytics. This includes dimensional modeling, which encompasses star and snowflake schema patterns.

5. **Architecture Patterns:** These patterns provide templates for solving problems at the architecture level. They describe fundamental structural organization schemas for software systems. Examples include Layered architecture, Event-driven architecture, and Microservices architecture.

6. **Enterprise Patterns:** These patterns address problems that are encountered in the enterprise context, dealing with high-level issues such as business process management, integration, messaging, and transaction management. They are often more complex and can encompass elements of the other types of patterns to solve business-specific problems.

All these patterns are aimed at simplifying the design process, promoting best practices, and creating a shared language among practitioners. They are not mutually exclusive and often overlap; for example, enterprise patterns can include database and software design patterns as part of a larger solution.

## Architecture patterns

Architecture patterns are high-level strategies that concern the overall layout of software applications. They provide a structure for the software system, determining how it will be organized and how its components will interact. Here are some common architecture patterns:

1. **Layered (n-tier) Architecture:**
   - Divides an application into logical layers, each with a specific role, such as presentation, business logic, data access, etc.
   - Commonly used in web applications, where you might see layers like a presentation layer (UI), application layer (server-side logic), business logic layer, and data access layer (database).

2. **Client-Server Architecture:**
   - Segregates the system into two applications, where the client makes requests to the server. In many cases, the server is a database with application logic represented as stored procedures.

3. **Master-Slave Architecture:**
   - Involves a master component that distributes work to identical slave components and computes a final result from the results returned by the slaves.

4. **Pipe-Filter Architecture:**
   - Consists of a chain of processing elements, arranged so that the output of each element is the input of the next; often used for stream processing.

5. **Broker Architecture:**
   - Distributes system functions among server components, known as services, which communicate through a broker (which could be a message broker or a service bus).

6. **Peer-to-Peer Architecture:**
   - Each node, or peer, acts as both a client and a server, with equal responsibilities and capabilities to use and provide resources.

7. **Event-Driven Architecture:**
   - Composed of event producers that generate a stream of events, and event consumers that listen for the events.
   - Reacts to events and triggers new actions based on those events.

8. **Microservices Architecture:**
   - Structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which implement business capabilities.
   - Services in a microservices architecture can be deployed independently, scaled individually, and developed in different programming languages.

9. **Space-Based Architecture:**
   - Designed to avoid functional collapse under high load by splitting processing and storage between multiple servers.

10. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):**
    - Organizes the architecture as a collection of services that are reusable and interoperable across different networks and domains.

Each architectural pattern has its own advantages and trade-offs, and the choice of which to use often depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the project at hand. These patterns provide a way to ensure that a system is structured in a way that meets its requirements, is maintainable, and is scalable.

## - Special: Enterprise Pattern SAP

\<<
What about SAP? It's enterprise pattern?

\>> SAP, which stands for Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing, is a global company that provides enterprise software to manage business operations and customer relations. The software solutions offered by SAP are rich in enterprise patterns, which are reusable solutions to common problems within a given context in software design. 

https://www.sap.com/products/erp.html

In the context of SAP and other enterprise systems, these patterns can be categorized as follows:

Module Patterns: These define the basic building blocks of SAP applications, structuring the system into functional modules like finance, sales, procurement, etc.

Master Data Management Patterns: These are concerned with the handling of core business data (like customer data, product data, employee data, etc.) across different modules within SAP.

Transactional Patterns: These focus on the processing of business transactions, ensuring data consistency, and integrity across the entire enterprise system.

Integration Patterns: SAP must integrate with various systems, so it employs patterns for data exchange and process integration, both within different SAP modules and with external systems.

Reporting and Analytics Patterns: SAP provides sophisticated reporting and analytics tools, using patterns that support business intelligence, data warehousing, and operational reporting.

Process Patterns: These are workflows and processes that are commonly used in business operations, which SAP standardizes and automates.

User Interface Patterns: SAP systems use a set of UI patterns to ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience across its various modules.

In the broader scope of enterprise patterns, the SAP software architecture also reflects high-level structural patterns such as:

Layered architecture: Separating the system into layers such as presentation, application, and database layers.

Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA): SAP uses SOA principles to structure the functionalities as reusable services.

Microservices architecture: Although traditionally monolithic, SAP has been moving towards a more microservices-oriented approach for greater flexibility and scalability.

These enterprise patterns are not exclusive to SAP; they are widely used across various enterprise systems to solve common problems in system design and operations. SAP's implementation of these patterns is tailored to its complex and comprehensive suite of enterprise applications.

## Database Design Patterns

<<
What are more database design patterns?

\>>
Database design patterns are methods for organizing databases to address specific problems and requirements in data management. They help in creating a robust and scalable database schema. Here are more patterns you might encounter:

1. **Star Schema**: A type of data warehouse schema that is optimized for querying large datasets. It features a central fact table referencing a number of dimension tables.

2. **Snowflake Schema**: A more complex data warehouse schema where the dimension tables from the star schema are normalized.

3. **Data Vault Modeling**: A hybrid approach that aims to provide long-term historical storage of data coming in from multiple operational systems, structured in a way that is resilient to changes in the source systems.

4. **Dimensional Modeling**: A design pattern used in data warehouse design that aims to make databases understandable and fast. It involves fact tables linked to dimension tables.

5. **Normalized Database Design**: Involves organizing the data in your database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

6. **Denormalized Database Design**: Sometimes used for performance optimization in read-heavy databases, it involves merging tables and reducing the number of joins needed for queries.

7. **Sharding Pattern**: Splits large databases into smaller, faster, more easily managed parts called data shards.

8. **Indexing Patterns**: Strategies for using indexes to improve database performance, such as composite indexing, partial indexing, and covering indexing.

9. **Archival Patterns**: Methods for archiving old data, such as moving it to slower, cheaper storage, while keeping it accessible for queries.

10. **Replication Patterns**: Strategies for copying data from one database to another to increase the availability and redundancy of data.

11. **Partitioning Patterns**: Dividing a database into distinct, independent parts to improve manageability, performance, and availability.

12. **Audit Trail Patterns**: Techniques for keeping a record of who did what in the database, typically by using triggers to capture changes in audit tables.

13. **Soft Delete Pattern**: Instead of physically deleting records from the database, they are marked as inactive or deleted with a status flag.

14. **Materialized View Pattern**: Involves storing the result of a database query and refreshing it periodically, to optimize for read performance.

15. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) Pattern**: Separates the writing and reading of data into different models, allowing for optimization of performance and scalability for each operation.

These design patterns and techniques are often chosen based on specific project requirements, and a database may implement multiple patterns to address different needs. Understanding these patterns is crucial for database architects and developers when designing systems that require efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Database Access Patterns

Database access patterns refer to the typical ways in which data is retrieved from or stored in a database. These patterns are an essential consideration in database design, as they affect performance, scalability, and maintainability of data storage solutions. Understanding and optimizing for the most common access patterns can lead to more efficient data operations and better application performance.

Here are several common database access patterns:

1. **Sequential Access**:
   - Data is accessed in a specific order, often sorted by one or more columns.
   - This pattern is common in batch processing jobs or when processing records that are naturally ordered, such as time-series data.

2. **Random Access**:
   - Data is accessed without a specific order, potentially anywhere in the dataset.
   - This is typical for transactional databases where individual records are queried or updated based on user actions.

3. **Indexed Access**:
   - Indexes are created on certain columns to speed up the retrieval of data.
   - Access patterns that rely on indexed searches can drastically reduce the amount of data that must be scanned for a query.

4. **Full Table Scan**:
   - The entire table is scanned to find relevant rows.
   - Full table scans can be inefficient but may be necessary for certain types of queries that cannot be optimized with indexes.

5. **Join Operations**:
   - Data from multiple tables is combined based on related columns.
   - Optimizing join operations is crucial when dealing with relational databases as they can be expensive in terms of performance.

6. **Write-heavy vs. Read-heavy**:
   - Some databases are optimized for writing data, while others are accessed mostly for reading. Understanding the ratio of read to write operations is key for tuning the database.

7. **Bulk Operations**:
   - Bulk insert, update, or delete operations affect many rows at once.
   - These operations can be optimized differently from single-row operations, often involving different transaction log handling or locking mechanisms.

8. **Time-based Access**:
   - Access to data might be influenced by temporal aspects, like accessing records from the last 30 days more frequently.
   - Caching strategies can be used to improve performance for such access patterns.

9. **Pattern-based Access**:
   - Certain applications may frequently query data that meets specific criteria, like all users who have logged in within a week or products that are below a certain stock level.

10. **Caching Common Queries**:
    - Frequently accessed data is stored in a cache for quick retrieval.
    - Understanding common queries helps in designing effective caching strategies to reduce database load.

11. **Sharding or Partitioning**:
    - Data is distributed across different tables or databases to spread out the load.
    - This is common in high-volume systems where access patterns need to scale horizontally across servers.

When designing a database schema, architects try to anticipate these access patterns and optimize the data model accordingly. For instance, if sequential access is expected to be the most common pattern, data might be stored in a way that supports efficient sequential reads and writes. Similarly, for random access patterns, the use of appropriate indexes is crucial.

Analyzing and understanding access patterns is an ongoing task, as the way data is used can evolve over time. Database monitoring tools can help to identify bottlenecks and inform decisions on indexing, partitioning, and scaling. It's also important to balance the overhead that some access patterns and optimizations can introduce against the benefits they provide, keeping in mind the specific needs and constraints of the application and hardware in use.

## - Reworded: Database Access Patterns
Access patterns in the context of databases refer to the typical ways in which the data in the database is queried and updated. Understanding access patterns is crucial for optimizing database and application performance, as well as for designing the schema. Here are some examples:

1. **Read-Heavy vs. Write-Heavy Workloads:**
   - Read-heavy access patterns involve frequent read operations compared to writes. This is common in analytics or reporting databases.
   - Write-heavy access patterns are common in transactional systems where data is constantly being updated.

2. **Random vs. Sequential Access:**
   - Random access patterns involve reading or writing data in no particular order. This can be less efficient due to disk seek time if the data is spread out.
   - Sequential access patterns involve processing data in a fixed order, typically much faster due to reduced disk seek times.

3. **Full Table Scans vs. Index Lookups:**
   - Full table scans read every row in a table and are typically slower, used when a query cannot take advantage of indexes.
   - Index lookups are used to quickly locate the rows needed for a query, significantly faster if the index supports the query's conditions.

4. **OLTP vs. OLAP:**
   - Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) typically involves a large number of short, atomic transactions that require rapid query processing and a high degree of concurrency.
   - Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) deals with fewer, more complex queries that often require scanning large volumes of data to aggregate information.

5. **Hot vs. Cold Data Access:**
   - Hot data is accessed frequently and usually needs to be retrieved quickly, often stored in faster storage or kept in memory.
   - Cold data is accessed infrequently and can be stored on slower, cheaper storage media.

6. **Time-Based Access:**
   - Some applications have peak usage times where the access load is significantly higher, which needs to be accounted for in capacity planning and scaling strategies.

7. **Pattern-Based Access:**
   - In some applications, data access follows a predictable pattern based on user behavior, like accessing user profiles more often than other types of data.

Understanding these patterns helps in several ways:

- **Indexing:** Choosing the right indexes for your queries can dramatically improve performance.
- **Partitioning:** Data can be partitioned based on the access pattern to improve manageability and performance.
- **Caching:** Frequently accessed data can be cached to speed up read operations.
- **Scalability:** Knowing access patterns helps in designing systems that can scale out (add more nodes) or scale up (add more resources to existing nodes).
- **Data Modeling:** Designing the database schema in a way that aligns with access patterns can optimize data retrieval and storage.

Designing with access patterns in mind is essential for building efficient and scalable systems.

## Data warehouse design

Data warehouse design refers to the process of constructing a data storage system that is used for reporting and data analysis—essentially, a central repository of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. It involves collecting, cleansing, and storing data to enable efficient and insightful business intelligence (BI) activities.

Here are the key aspects of data warehouse design:

1. **Data Integration**: Combining data from different sources into a single, coherent structure. The integration process often involves data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).

2. **Schema Design**: Structuring the data warehouse schema in a way that supports BI needs. The two most common schema designs are the star schema and the snowflake schema.

3. **Historical Data Storage**: Data warehouses are designed to store historical data to enable trends analysis over time, which is not typically a focus of operational databases.

4. **Data Quality and Consistency**: Ensuring that data is cleansed and standardized so that the same data element has the same meaning across different datasets and reports.

5. **Query Performance**: Designing the data warehouse to support complex queries and reports quickly. This often involves creating indexes, materialized views, and pre-aggregated tables.

6. **Data Volume and Scalability**: Planning for current and future data volume to ensure the data warehouse can scale as data grows. This may involve hardware considerations as well as database design.

7. **Business Alignment**: The design should align with business objectives and support business processes, decision-making, and performance monitoring.

8. **Security**: Implementing data access controls and other security measures to protect sensitive data.

9. **Backup and Recovery**: Planning for regular backups and having strategies in place for data recovery in case of failures.

The design process is iterative and often requires collaboration between IT and business stakeholders to ensure that the data warehouse meets the needs of its users. Good design considers not only how to store the data but also how it will be used, ensuring that the end solution is efficient for both storage and query purposes.
