The previous challenge at [[2a. Chrome extension foundational with popup]] includes popup but it also included a bunch of foundational information that's important for developing any chrome extension presentation (popup, content, devtools panel, devtools sidebar, etc). This tutorial will go over popup again but without the general foundationals. 

We will go more in-depth into the popup to layer more tools and know-how when it comes to implementing Chrome extension popup (again, can be thought of as a popover when you click a chrome extension pinned icon on the web browser).

Key takeaways:
- Popup can have multiple local extension html pages. Otherwise, remote links need to be opened in a tab whether it's the current tab or new tab. A quick and easy way to open in a new tab is to assign target `_blank` to the link.
- Chrome's activeTab API allows you to inject CSS (style block), javascript (script block), html, and execution (javascript). So changes can include document title changes (which also changes the tab title) and favico changes.
- Chrome has a more intrusive tabs API but many use cases just need activeTab (work on the current active tab)
- You can set or change the badge which is a visual indicator at the Chrome Extension icon on Chrome. Affecting the badge is part of the Chrome's Action API (`chrome.action...`)

## Multipage

Let's add ability to have multiple pages in the popup:

Create a popup2.html

popup2.html:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Popup</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="popup.css">
</head>

<body>
    <h1>YOUR_APP</h1>

    <main>
        <div>
            By Weng:
        </div>

        <aside>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.github.com/Siphon880gh/" rel="nofollow">
                <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white"
                    data-canonical-src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github&amp;logoColor=white"
                    style="max-width: 100%; height:20px;">
            </a>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/weng-fung/" rel="nofollow">
                <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-blue?style=flat&logo=linkedin&labelColor=blue"
                    alt="Linked-In"
                    data-canonical-src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-blue?style=flat&amp;logo=linkedin&amp;labelColor=blue"
                    style="max-width:100%;">
            </a>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@WayneTeachesCode/" rel="nofollow">
                <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Youtube-red?style=flat&logo=youtube&labelColor=red" alt="Youtube"
                    data-canonical-src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Youtube-red?style=flat&amp;logo=youtube&amp;labelColor=red"
                    style="max-width:100%;">
            </a>
        </aside>

        <div class="spacer-vertical"></div>
        <h2>Title:</h2>
        <p>LOREM IPSUM DOLOR SIT AMET CONSECTETUR ADIPISICING ELIT. REPELLENDUS HIC SIT LIBERO? EXCEPTURI, OPTIO AUT
            REICIENDIS DOLOREMQUE TEMPORE, ISTE HARUM ASPERNATUR ET, OFFICIIS EARUM ALIQUAM. QUIBUSDAM CUM NOSTRUM QUOS
            COMMODI?</p>

        <div class="spacer-vertical"></div>
        <button id="alert-me">Alert me</button>

        <div class="spacer-vertical"></div>
        <a href="popup.html">Popup.html</a>

    </main>
    <script src="popup.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```


^Notice that the new popup2.html links back to the original popup.html

Add link to new page at the original popup.html: (add before `</main>` closing tag)
```
	<div role="spacer-vertical" style="margin-top:11px"></div>
	<a href="popup2.html">Popup2.html</a>
</main>
```

Let's think about how it should look. The popup should show "Lorem ipsum" text. Clicking the link to popup2.html at the bottom of the popup will show all caps "LOREM IPSUM" text.


![[Chrome-Extension-Popup-Multipage.gif]]

---

## External links

At popup.html, let's change the link to (right before the `</main>` closing tag):
```
	<div role="spacer-vertical" style="margin-top:11px"></div>
	<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>
</main>
```


Update Chrome extension, open popup, and click the Google link.
Nothing happens! 

If you inspected the popup, there's no error in console. However, in Network, you'll see that it's cancelled and 0 size downloaded. There's no other hints (Even Response tab of that network request is just blank):
![[Pasted image 20250320211611.png]]


#### External Links with Target blank

Adjust popup.html's link by adding `target="_blank"`
```

        <div class="spacer-vertical"></div>
        <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>

    </main>

```

Update the chrome extension, open, and test clicking the Google link.

Notice it opens this time. But it opens in new tab.

There are no permission settings in manifest.json. The way to open external links is through opening in a tab, NOT within the popup.


----

### External Links with Chrome Tabs Behavior Hard-coded

This may seem trivial, but you can control if the link opens in the current active tab or always open a new tab using Chrome's Tabs API:

![[Chrome-Extension-Tab-Control.gif]]

Adjust popup.html's link code back to normal targeting (remove `target="_blank"`):
```
        <div class="spacer-vertical"></div>
        <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>

    </main>

```

Add this to popup.js:
```
// Global setting: true = open in new tab, false = reuse active tab
const openInNewTab = true;

document.body.onclick = function(e) {
  e = e || event;
  const target = e.target || e.srcElement;

  if (target.nodeName !== 'A') return;

  const href = target.href;

  if (openInNewTab) {
    chrome.tabs.create({ url: href });
  } else {
    chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true }, function(tabs) {
      chrome.tabs.update(tabs[0].id, { url: href });
    });
  }

  return false;
};
```

^Explanation of the rest of the code around `openInNewTab`:
 The `popup.js` detects click event on body of popup page, and okays it for being a `<a>` link that's actually been clicked. Then it sees if the checkbox is ticked, to decide to create a new tab (`chrome.tabs.create`) or to update the active current tab (`chrome.tabs.update` with the url stored in `href` and the tab ID of the current active tab stored from `tabs[0].id`). 

With `openInNewTab` set to true, the link will open in new window. WIth it false, the link will open in the same window. Try both, updating the Chrome Extension then testing the link in the popup.

No need to add activeTab and tab permissions. Those are for more particular reasons than just opening an url at a new tab or current tab:
- [[Permission activeTab - Chrome Extension]]
- [[Permission tabs - Chrome Extension]]

### External Links with Chrome Tabs Behavior User Ticked

Let's instead of having to change the code `openInNewTab`, let's have a checkbox that gives the user the option to have links open in the current tab or a new tab:

Unchecked will open link at active tab:
![[Pasted image 20250321155122.png]]

Checked will open link at new tab:
![[Pasted image 20250321155142.png]]


Update popup.html to have a row of open tab options:
- Added three lines (emmet pseudocode) `div>(label+input)` above the Google link
```

        <div class="spacer-vertical"></div>
        <div>
            <label for="open-in-new-tab">Open in new tab</label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="open-in-new-tab">
        </div>
        <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>

    </main>
```


Update entire popup.js:
- Instead of defining the boolean openInNewTab, it assigns boolean based on whether the checkbox is checked
```
document.getElementById("alert-me").addEventListener("click", function() {
    alert("Alerted");
});

document.body.onclick = function(e) {
  e = e || event;
  const target = e.target || e.srcElement;

  if (target.nodeName !== 'A') return;

  const href = target.href;

  const openInNewTab = document.getElementById("open-in-new-tab").checked;
  if (openInNewTab) {
    chrome.tabs.create({ url: href });
  } else {
    chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true }, function(tabs) {
      chrome.tabs.update(tabs[0].id, { url: href });
    });
  }

  return false;
};
```

## External Tabs with HTML Modified, but Tied to Popup Session

Let's have all tabs that are opened at active tab change tab title to "ACTIVE" and get a red fav icon. User will be able to see which tabs were opened actively versus newly by tab titles and favicon's. Unfortunately we can't change the tab's entire color which would be easier to identify than a red favicon (You can have colored tabs in Chrome theme extension but that doesn't allow for dynamic tab color changes which we need here)

Firstly, check if this icon still exists (by customicondesign_1 https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/round_16000326?term=red&page=1&position=2&origin=tag&related_id=16000326). We need a remotely hosted fav icon since we will be changing the favico of the source code for google.com in our web browser:
https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/16000/16000326.png

If no longer exists, find another icon and grab its png url.

Add to manifest.json:
```
"permissions": ["scripting", "activeTab"],
"host_permissions": [  
	"http://*/*",  
	"https://*/*"  
]
```

^ The scripting permission allows you to inject into a tab. The activeTab permission lets you modify or read from the active tab's source code (including the title and favicon). 
^ Tabs permission is not required because you're only accessing the active tab. Furthermore, the user installing your chrome extension won't be asked permission to all tabs, which is a tad scary.
^ You must add host_permissions to google or wildcarded like the above so that google can be allowed. Otherwise this would not work and inspecting the popup's console would show: `popup.js:54 Failed to execute script: Error: Cannot access contents of the page. Extension manifest must request permission to access the respective host.`

Change popup.js to:
```
document.getElementById("alert-me").addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Alerted");
});

document.body.onclick = function(e) {
e = e || event;
const target = e.target || e.srcElement;

if (target.nodeName !== 'A') return;

const href = target.href;
console.log('Link clicked:', href);

const openInNewTab = document.getElementById("open-in-new-tab").checked;
if (openInNewTab) {
  chrome.tabs.create({ url: href });
} else {
  chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true }, function(tabs) {
    console.log('Current tab found:', tabs[0].id);
    const tabId = tabs[0].id;
    chrome.tabs.update(tabId, { url: href }, async (tabInfo) => {
      console.log('Tab updated, waiting for load...');
      // Wait for the tab to complete loading
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); // Give the page time to load
      
      try {
        console.log('Attempting to change favicon...');
        await chrome.scripting.executeScript({
          target: { tabId: tabId },
          func: () => {
            console.log('Script executing in tab...');

            // Change favicon
            const link = document.querySelector("link[rel*='icon']") || document.createElement('link');
            link.type = 'image/x-icon';
            link.rel = 'shortcut icon';
            link.href = 'https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/16000/16000326.png';
            document.head.appendChild(link);

            // Change title
            document.title = "ACTIVE";

            // Add visual feedback
            console.log('Favicon changed successfully');
            const notification = document.createElement('div');
            notification.textContent = 'Favicon changed!';
            notification.style.cssText = 'position: fixed; top: 20px; right: 20px; background: #4CAF50; color: white; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; z-index: 9999;';
            document.body.appendChild(notification);
            setTimeout(() => notification.remove(), 3000);
          }
        });
        console.log('Script execution completed');
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to execute script:', error);
      }
    });
  });
}

return false;
};
```


^You can see from the code that upon updating the active tab's url, there's a callback (third argument) waiting for some time (for the entire google.com to finish loading), then changing the favico, changing the title, and adding a temporary green notification message "Fav icon changed" for 3 seconds.

Update the Chrome extension then test it out. Try to create 2 tabs labeled "ACTIVE" and 2 tabs not labeled active by checkboxing or not checkboxing, then clicking the Google link in the popup:
![[Pasted image 20250321174551.png]]

Please note there's a temporary green notification message "Fav icon changed" for 3 seconds. You *MUST* keep the popup opened for that notification to appear AND for the title and favico change (once the green notification appears, you can dismiss the popup):
![[Pasted image 20250321174732.png]]

Pay attention to 2 annoyances:
- If you dismiss the popup after opening a Google link, there's a huge change that the favico and title doesn't change for the active tab, even though google.com opens. The reason why is that popup.js will abort if the popup.html is not shown, by design. We want to defer the work to background.js instead, which can run scripts despite having no chrome extension presentation (like a popup) opened!
- Another annoying thing is as soon as you close the popup, it forgets your checkbox setting! So when you created two active tabs, you had to check "Open in new tab" again. Next section we'll work on storage to save the settings.

## Badge WIP Wait but Tied to Popup Session's Brief Function

Before we fix those annoyances, let's add a visual feedback to tell user to "WAIT" (instead of dismissing the popup). We can add this at the chrome extension icon. I didn't want to complicate the code too much at first so you could understand it. Let's add it now.

Above `chrome.tabs.update` at popup.js, add:
```
    chrome.action.setBadgeText({
      tabId: tabId,
      text: "WAIT",
    });
    chrome.action.setBadgeBackgroundColor({
      tabId: tabId,
      color: "#FF0000",
    });
```

When you open a tab, the Chrome extension icon will have red rectangle with the word "WAIT":
![[Pasted image 20250321182758.png]]

^ We can't have longer text to explain exactly what we want user to do (because "WAIT..." starts getting cut off because of a character limit)

The intention is to tell user not to dismiss the popup and just wait a bit. Unfortunately, because that code is tied to a function that runs and closes quickly (next function async), the badge doesn't stay for as long as the user is supposed to wait until dismissing the popup. It's the same deal if you move the badge text code to another enclosure, it'll show briefly, just at a different time.

![[Chrome-Extension-Badge-Text-Too-Quick.gif]]

So that's a third annoyance. This one is solved through background.js

---

We will solve these annoyances / shortcomings in the next tutorial:
- The popup.js will abort if you dismiss the popup.html before favico and title gets changed on the active tab opened via the link to google.
- Your checkbox setting for opening at the active tab or in a new tab gets forgotten each time you re-open the popup.
- Badge status telling user to "Wait" before dismissing the popup goes away too quickly.
