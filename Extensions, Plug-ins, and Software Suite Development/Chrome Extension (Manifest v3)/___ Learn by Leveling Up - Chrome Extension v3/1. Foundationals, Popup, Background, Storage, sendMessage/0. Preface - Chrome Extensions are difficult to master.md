Why does it seem difficult?

To build solid browser extensions, you need to know when to read from or inject UI elements directly into a webpage. This is where content scripts come in—they allow you to interact with the page’s DOM and insert extension resources like CSS or JS via web-accessible resources.

You also need to understand when to use service workers (previously called background.js). These are the brains of your extension—handling things like coordination, messaging between parts of the extension, and background tasks.

Content scripts require a deep understanding of the DOM, how and when pages render, the event loop, and browser events. Service workers, on the other hand, follow a different model, requiring knowledge of networking, window/frame lifecycles, storage, and message passing.

Knowing when to use popup.html or sidepanel.html is just as important. And if you’re building tools that enhance Chrome’s debugging features, you'll want to dive into adding a DevTools panel or a sidebar pane.

Unfortunately, the communication syntax often changes depending on the context—for example:
Querying the DOM from content.js,
Using executeScript from a service worker to inject into a tab,
Or running inspectedWindow.eval from a DevTools panel.

For more logic-heavy extensions, it’s essential to understand how to use sendMessage, onMessage, the Storage API, and how each part of the extension communicates. 

You’ll also need to understand how to configure Content Security Policy (CSP), permissions, and host_permissions in your manifest.json. CSP controls what external resources your extension can load (and can trip you up if you're using inline scripts or third-party resources). Permissions and host_permissions determine what APIs and domains your extension can access—getting this right is essential for functionality and for passing the Chrome Web Store review process

This is all part of the unique architecture of Chrome extensions.

Building extensions is not like building a standard web app. The structure and workflows are different, which can make it challenging for newcomers to figure out a clean setup.

If you’re just starting out, I recommend sticking with plain JavaScript and building a few basic extensions with a simple popup.html. Once you're comfortable, try a lightweight framework like Svelte—it works really well with Chrome extensions (search: Chrome Extension Svelte).

Extensions can feel overwhelming at first, but they’re incredibly powerful. Unlike a regular website, you’re literally extending the browser’s capabilities.
