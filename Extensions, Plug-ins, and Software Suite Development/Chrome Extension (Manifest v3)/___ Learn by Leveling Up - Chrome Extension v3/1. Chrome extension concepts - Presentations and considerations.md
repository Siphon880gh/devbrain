Chrome extension can consist of one or more presentations depending on the use case of the chrome extension you're making:
- Popup (can be thought of as a popover)
- Content (aka webpage reading from or writing to)
- Options page
- Devtools panel
- Devtools sidebar

| Component        | Purpose                                                                | Example Use Case                                      |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Content Script   | To interact with the webpage DOM and inject code.                      | Modifying webpage content or scraping data.           |
| Pop-up UI        | A temporary interface that appears when the extension icon is clicked. | Dropdown menus, buttons, or summaries.                |
| DevTools Panel   | A dedicated tab in Chrome's DevTools for custom tools.                 | Debugging frameworks like React or Redux.             |
| DevTools Sidebar | A sidebar in the existing DevTools for contextual element analysis.    | Displaying additional metadata about inspected items. |
| Options Page     | A settings page for user preferences and configuration.                | Choosing default themes, API authentication, etc.     |

There are additional presentations that are less often used and are more new to Chrome extensions:
- Browser action
	- Purpose: Adds an icon to the toolbar, which can open a pop-up or run scripts..
	- Example Use Case: Clicking the extension icon triggers a pop-up or executes a function
	- Manifest v3 doc: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/reference/browserAction
- Side Panel
	- Available on Chrome 114+ (May 30, 2023)
	- Purpose: Provides an always-visible UI separate from the pop-up (which is temporarily visible).
	- Example Use Case: Persistent note-taking, pinned reference content. |
	- Manifest v3 doc: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sidePanel

There are several JavaScript files, each serving a distinct purpose:
- Your popup.html would reference popup.js (unless you name it differently) and your devtool sidepanel and/or devtool panel would reference devtools.js (unless you name it differently)
- content.js and background.js (unless named differently in manifest.json) are scripts that are just loaded. they aren't loaded with html file because there's no presentation markup. 

1. **popup.js**: Manages a popover modal that is displayed when the Chrome extension icon is clicked. The popup modal appears over the Chrome web browser. You also would need a popup.html
2. **content.js**: Injected into the active page when the Chrome extension is activated, allowing modification and interaction with the webpage (You’re not allowed to modify the active webpage from popup.js because Chrome really takes the separations of concerns seriously).
3. **background.js**: Optional and serves for background processing. background.js is responsible for managing tasks that persist in the background, independent of any user interface elements like popups or content scripts. It can listen for browser events, manage state, and communicate with other parts of the extension, such as content scripts and popups.
4. **devtools.js**: file in a Chrome extension is associated with extending the functionality of Chrome Developer Tools. Developers can create custom panels and extend existing features within the Developer Tools using this file, allowing for enhanced debugging, analysis, and interaction with web pages.

To achieve many of the user interactions and use cases of chrome extension, there are other aspects of Chrome extension that you may have to code
 - Content security policy
 - Background js
 - chrome.runtime sendMessage and onMessage
	 - This allows communications between different presentations of Chrome Extension. It also allows communication between background.js and other presentations. Communication is the sending of data including string messages
 - Storage sync and local:
	 - Loading of stored data including settings when a presentation first loads (eg. Options page). Sync will save the data across all Chrome's under the user's profile. Local will just say it to the local Chrome
 - Icons (chrome extension icon, store icon)
 - App name, version, description (Chrome web store)

Some additional chrome aspects you can influence include:
- Color of a tab
- Whether the chrome extension options page can be part of the chrome extensions layout or on a separate tab

The Chrome API can do a lot with the web browser but not all presentations of Chrome has the same amount of access to the Chrome API

| **Component**                          | **Can Access Chrome APIs Directly?**                                                                                  | **APIs Available**                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Background Script**                  | Has full access to almost all Chrome APIs.                                                                            | Example APIs: `chrome.runtime`, `chrome.tabs`, `chrome.storage`, `chrome.webRequest`, `chrome.scripting`, etc.                               |
| **Content Script**                     | Limited access. Content scripts operate in the **webpage's environment** and cannot access most Chrome APIs directly. | Only has access to **`chrome.runtime`** (used for messaging) and can communicate with the background script or other parts of the extension. |
| **Popup Script**                       | Has full access to almost all Chrome APIs.                                                                            | Example APIs: `chrome.runtime`, `chrome.storage`, `chrome.tabs`, etc.                                                                        |
| **DevTools Panel and SIdebar Scripts** | Yes, but with some restrictions (DevTools scripts operate in the DevTools context).                                   | Example APIs: `chrome.runtime`, `chrome.devtools.*`, etc.                                                                                    |
| **Options Page**                       | Has full access to almost all Chrome APIs..                                                                           | Example APIs: `chrome.runtime`, `chrome.storage`\|                                                                                           |

Popup, options page, and background can be said to operate in the **extension environment**, meaning they have **access to most of Chrome’s APIs**. However, they **do have some limitations** when compared to `background.js`.

There is also a matter of what domains can be connected to to make API requests with fetch, or to load images with img tags, which are defined in manifest.json's content_security_policy. There are also domains that your connect js is allowed to connect to, and that's determined by manifest.json's host_permissions
