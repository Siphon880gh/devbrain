You can get to see devtools and the panelâ€™s console logs by right clicking inside the panel then going to Inspect. Notice another devtools have opened to the bottom right of screenshot:

You could also Inspect from a Sidebar to open the DevTools Console:

Regardless the panel or sidebar where you inspected to open the console, they'll share the same console.

So you can have the console opened for the web content and a console for your DevTools:

^ Notice the warning at the web content console is not related to our code at all but to duckduckgo's own code. Notice our DevTools console has console logged much information about our panel or sidebar and injecting code into the web content.

Now if our injected code caused errors, it would show under the web content console.
