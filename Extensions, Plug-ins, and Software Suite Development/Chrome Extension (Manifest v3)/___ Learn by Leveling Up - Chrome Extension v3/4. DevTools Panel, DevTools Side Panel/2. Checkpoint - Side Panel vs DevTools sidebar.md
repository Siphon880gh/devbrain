Make sure to not get these words confused. They mean different things in Chrome Extension presentations.

Note that side panel is this:

But DevTools sidebar is part of the DevTools (CMD+OPT+I or CMD+OPT+J). The sidebar is only accessible if the Elements panel is active. See the bottom right for the DevTools sidebar pane:

So remember they are different:
- Side Panel
- DevTools Sidebar
	- Sometimes referred as DevTools Sidebar Pane
	- Sometimes as DevTools Elements Sidebar Pane
