The previous challenge at [[2 Chrome extension foundational with popup and content]] includes popup and content but it also included a bunch of foundational information that's important for developing any chrome extension presentation (popup, content, devtools panel, devtools sidebar, etc). This tutorial will go over popup again but without the general foundationals. 

We will go more in-depth into the popup to layer more tools and know-how when it comes to implementing Chrome extension popup (again, can be thought of as a popover when you click a chrome extension pinned icon on the web browser).

Popup - Menu-like popover is still all CSS and HTML, but there is a Chrome theme api that helps a bit. Refer to [[Popup looking like a native Chrome menu]]
