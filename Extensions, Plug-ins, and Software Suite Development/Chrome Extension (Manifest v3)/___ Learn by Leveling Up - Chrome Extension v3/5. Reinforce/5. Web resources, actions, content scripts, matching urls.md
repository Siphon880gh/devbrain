## Setup

### Create icons
You should know how. But if you need a review: [[2a. Chrome extension foundational with popup]] for section "manifest.json Icons"

### Create manifest.json

```
{
  "name": "Chrome Extension",
  "description": "By Weng Fei Fung. Various demo's to teach you how to build a chrome extension.",
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "version": "1.0",
  "icons": {
      "16": "icon16x16.png",
      "32": "icon32x32.png",
      "48": "icon48x48.png",
      "128": "icon128x128.png"
  },
  "content_security_policy": {
      "extension_pages": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; object-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' *; connect-src 'self'"
  },
  "permissions": [
      "activeTab",
      "tabs",
      "scripting"
  ],
  "action": {
    "default_icon": "icon.png"
  },
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "web_accessible_resources": [
    {
      "resources": ["icon.png"],
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"]
    }
  ]
}
```

^without “scripting” permission, background.js would error Error in event handler: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'executeScript') 
^without “action”, background.js would error with Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'onClicked')  which you can see from the chrome://extensions errors button at the extension’s card AND you wouldn't be able to trigger code by clicking the chrome extension

### Create background.js

```
chrome.action.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
  chrome.scripting.executeScript({
    target: { tabId: tab.id },
    files: ["execute.js"],
  });
});
```

### Create execute.js

```
document.body.prepend((()=>{
  const img = document.createElement("img");
  img.src = chrome.runtime.getURL("icon.png");
  img.style.width = "100px";
  img.style.height = "100px";
  img.style.position = "fixed";
  img.style.top = "10px";
  img.style.left = "10px";
  img.style.zIndex = "1000";
  return img;
})());

document.body.prepend((()=>{
  const img = document.createElement("img");
  img.src = `chrome-extension://${chrome.runtime.id}/icon.png`;
  img.style.width = "100px";
  img.style.height = "100px";
  img.style.position = "fixed";
  img.style.top = "10px";
  img.style.right = "10px";
  img.style.zIndex = "1000";
  return img;
})());

```

## Discussion about function action

### Testing

Update the chrome extension and start testing it at google.com. Click the Chrome extension to see this happen (Yours may look different depending on icon.png):
![[Pasted image 20250406234813.png]]

The code activated when you clicked the chrome extension (rather than opening a popup overlaying chrome or opening a side panel), therefore this is a "function action", which calls a function at background.js (the event handler that `chrome.action.onClicked` handles)
### Code flow

When user clicks the chrome extension, the background.js handles the click at:
```
chrome.action.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
  chrome.scripting.executeScript({
    target: { tabId: tab.id },
    files: ["execute.js"],
  });
});
```

And that runs execute.js, which creates the two images at the top-left and top-right based off icon.png. If you look at the code, then you see there are two ways to construct url's to chrome extension assets:
- `img.src = chrome.runtime.getURL("icon.png");`
- `img.src = `chrome://${chrome.runtime.id}/icon.png;`

Regardless of which way, they both evaluate to the same string. The exact url depends on your Chrome extension's ID which can be found here at chrome://extensions at your extension's card:
![[Pasted image 20250406235726.png]]

If you inspect for the URL at either picture, you can copy the URL to another tab. You can visit chrome extension assets like images and even html files directly this way:

Visiting the icon directly. My icon is a black square. Yours may look different.
![[Pasted image 20250406235813.png]]

Visiting manifest.json directly:
![[Pasted image 20250406235905.png]]

But to include these chrome extension url's on the web page (such like the two images that were created at the top left and top right), you needed to add the web_accessible_resources at manifest.json. Here we allowed for the icon.png url:
```
  "web_accessible_resources": [
    {
      "resources": ["icon.png"],
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"]
    }
  ]
```

## Conversion into onload content script

What if you want the code to execute on all pages without having to click the chrome extension icon? 

Then you don't need a background.js to constantly listen for the chrome extension icon click. You will assign a content script to the url (or all url's). The content script will automatically run when the webpage is done loading.

1. Remove background.js file and remove background entry from manifest.json. You can also remove the action entry from manifest.json since we don't need a part of CHrome extension to write to the web content using executeScript
2. Add content_scripts pointing to execute.js at manifest.json:
```
{
  "name": "DevTools Chrome Extension",
  "description": "By Weng Fei Fung. Various demo's to teach you how to build a chrome extension to enhance the DevTools that web developers use.",
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "version": "1.0",
  "icons": {
      "16": "icon16x16.png",
      "32": "icon32x32.png",
      "48": "icon48x48.png",
      "128": "icon128x128.png"
  },
  "content_security_policy": {
      "extension_pages": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; object-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' *; connect-src 'self'"
  },
  "permissions": [
      "activeTab",
      "tabs"
  ],
  "web_accessible_resources": [
    {
      "resources": ["icon.png"],
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"]
    }
  ],
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
      "js": ["execute.js"],
      "run_at": "document_end"
    }
  ]
}
```

And your folder structure could look like:
```
.
├── execute.js
├── icon.png
├── icon128x128.png
├── icon16x16.png
├── icon32x32.png
├── icon48x48.png
└── manifest.json
```

Update chrome extension. Visiting google.com should show the two icon images at the top left and the top right without you having to click the Chrome Extension icon:

![[Pasted image 20250406234813.png]]


## Conversion into specific url for content script

Right now the two images get created regardless of the url, whether google.com or not. More likely you'd be creating a chrome extension that's enhancing the user experience at a certain web platform or app.

Visiting ask.com also shows the two images:
![[Pasted image 20250407001056.png]]

To isolate the chrome extension content script to only a specific url is easy. See the matches subfield at manifest.json:
```
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://www.google.com/*", "https://google.com/*", "http://www.google.com/*", "http://google.com/*"],
      "js": ["execute.js"],
      "run_at": "document_end"
    }
  ]
```

Unfortunately, unlikely sourcing in html for css and js files, you can't simply use `//www.google.com/*` and `//google.com/*` to broadly stroke for https and http, because there will be an installation error: `Invalid value for 'content_scripts[X].matches[Y]': Invalid scheme`

This concludes the tutorial.
