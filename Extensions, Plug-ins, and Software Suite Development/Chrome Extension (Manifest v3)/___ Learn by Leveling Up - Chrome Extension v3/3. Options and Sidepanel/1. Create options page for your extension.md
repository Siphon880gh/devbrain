## Setup

Create icon files set and manifest.json file. You should know how by now.

Create manifest.json with these contents:
```
{  
    "manifest_version": 3,  
    "name": "<APP_NAME>",  
    "version": "1.0",  
    "description": "<APP_DESCRIPTION>.",  
    "author": "Weng Fei Fung",
    "icons": {  
        "16": "icon16x16.png",  
        "32": "icon32x32.png",  
        "48": "icon48x48.png",  
        "128": "icon128x128.png"  
    },
    "content_security_policy": {  
        "extension_pages": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; object-src 'self';"
    },
    "permissions": [
        "scripting", "tabs", "activeTab"
    ],
    "options_ui": {
      "page": "options.html",
      "open_in_tab": false
    }
}
```

Based on the manifest.json, we see that we have a new “options_ui” section and that it’s pointing to an options.html. So:...

Create options.html:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
    <title>Options</title>  
</head>  
  
<body>  
    <h1>Options</h1>  
</body>  
  
</html>
```

Update/install the chrome extension because we will do some preliminary testing next.

## Preliminary Testing

There are two major ways to open options page for your extension (or any extension):
- Open from extension icon
- Open from extensions page

---

### Open from extension icon

Access the options page of any chrome extension icon by right-clicking the icon then going to Options. Options page will always open in a tab (if extension options tab already exists, it switches to that tab and refreshes) (if extension options tab does not exist, it opens a new tab) in this way. Like so:

Right-click pinned icon if has been pinned:

Or if not pinned, expand extensions list, then expand “...” menu for our extension:
![[Pasted image 20250326202954.png]]

At extensions page, access the options page by going to Details... then going into Extension options (it’s not emphasized or anything)... then it’s going to open either as a popup modal or in a new tab
- [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)  
- ...then going into Details:
  ![[Pasted image 20250326203007.png]]
- Then going into Extension Options:
  ![[Pasted image 20250326203109.png]]

- Then it’s going to open either as a popup modal or a new tab
	- Open in a popup modal (`"open_in_tab": false`)
	  ![[Pasted image 20250326203129.png]]
	- Open in a new tab (`"open_in_tab": true`)
	  ![[Pasted image 20250326203154.png]]
