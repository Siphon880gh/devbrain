Titled: DevTools limitations - Chrome tabs and activeTabs, but can be overcame with background or inspectedWindow

The chrome.tabs. API is not exposed to the Developer Tools extension pages due to security considerations. If you have to work the current active tab, you can use the inspectedWindow API which can do most things including writing or changing content on the active page (which in this case is the Inspected Window because you have DevTools opened on the page, allowing you to inspect elements). 

But if you need more tab or activeTab features, you may have to pass the tabId (a property of inspectedWindow) along a message to background.js. Then background.js has access to your current tab.
