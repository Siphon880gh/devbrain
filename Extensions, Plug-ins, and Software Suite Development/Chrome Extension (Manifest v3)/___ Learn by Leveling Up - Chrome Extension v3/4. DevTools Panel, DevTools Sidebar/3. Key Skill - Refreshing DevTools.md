After updating or installing chrome extension, you have to close and reopen the DevTools to see the new tabs or new renders in Devtools panel or Devtools sidebar. The Chrome Extension adds the new tabs on the opening of Devtools (CMD+SHIFT+I, or CMD+SHIFT+J) - it does not update them in real time.

Your DevTools tabs do not appear if you're at a Chrome page like (chrome://extensions).
