An action could be a popup.html that appears when clicking the Chrome Extension icon (that you pin on Chrome). An action could also be a function that runs instead of a popup.html (We've briefly mentioned in a previous challenge but haven't implemented yet).

Badge has text and background. A badge is like the email count number next to the email app on your phone. It both notifies the user and informs the user of specific stats or state of the app.

For example, this chrome extension has a red badge with the word "WAIT":

You can set the text and the background color of a badge. If you set text to empty "", then it removes the badge.
