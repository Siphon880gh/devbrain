Originally the badge logic was in popup.js but we've since moved that logic to background.js, and have popup.js message background.js when it's time to start visualizing with the badge (Chrome extension icon).

- chrome.runtime.sendMessage**: Sends one-time messages between different parts of the extension (e.g., options page → content script).
- chrome.runtime.onMessage**: Listens for incoming messages in content scripts, background scripts, or other contexts and acts on them.
- Background Scripts for Relay (Optional)**: If needed, a background script can act as a middleman to forward runtime messages to multiple content scripts
	- ^ Relay: In general programming, a "relay" is any component that passes messages or data between two other components that don’t talk to each other directly.
