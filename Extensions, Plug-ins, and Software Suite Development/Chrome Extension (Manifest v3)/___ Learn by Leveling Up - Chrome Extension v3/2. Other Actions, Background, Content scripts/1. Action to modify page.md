Recall that there are popup actions where clicking a chrome extension opens an overlaying popup. And there are popup functions that clicking the chrome extension will run a javascript function.

We will use a function action so that clicking a chrome extension can modify the current active tab's page. For simplicity we will have it change the background color of the page.

Key takeaway:
- By not defining a "default_popup" in manifest.json's action, you change it to a function action.
- The function action expects background.js to listen for an onclick event from the Chrome's Action API (`chrome.action.onClicked.addListener`).
- User must click the Chrome Extension to run.

Setup the files from [[2a. Chrome extension foundational with popup]] with some variation (refer below).

Create manifest.json among other files including background.js to modify/read from the current webpage on the web browser.

### manifest.json

#### manifest.json Overview

manifest.json for content js (for reading/modifying from webpage):

manifest.json for a popup (for learning foundations):
- Manifest version 3.
- Include your app name, version and description (affects Chrome extension store) and icons to show on the web browser pinned extensions area, the Google chrome extension store, etc.
- Includes Content Security Policy rules which is permission and scoping.
- We are changing the `"action":` section from a popup action into a function action by removing `default_popup` property
- But for that function to be triggered, it has to be available 24/7 when the extension's been installed, so we need a background.js, in which case is a service worker because v3 has changed background mechanism to a service worker mechanism. We added a background section to manifest.

manifest.json:
```
{  
    "manifest_version": 3,  
    "name": "<APP_NAME>",  
    "version": "1.0",  
    "description": "<APP_DESCRIPTION>.",  
    "author": "Weng Fei Fung",
    "icons": {  
        "16": "icon16x16.png",  
        "32": "icon32x32.png",  
        "48": "icon48x48.png",  
        "128": "icon128x128.png"  
    },
    "content_security_policy": {  
        "extension_pages": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; object-src 'self';"
    },
    "action": {  
        "default_icon": "icon.png"
    },
    "background": {
	    "service_worker": "background.js"
    }
}
```
#### manifest.json CSP

You should know it by now. If you need to, review [[2b. Content Security Policy - script, style, object, img, connect, default - Foundational]].

#### manifest.json Icons

You should know how to generate or create icons by now. If you need to, review [[2b. Content Security Policy - script, style, object, img, connect, default - Foundational]]. 

If you dont have icons, the installation will fail with the error:
![[Pasted image 20250319004613.png]]

#### manifest.json Function Action

manifest.json → action: 
Make sure there's no popup.html this time at manifest.json:

```
    "action": {  
        "default_icon": "icon.png",
    },
```


We will listen for chrome extension onclick at background.js. Add to background.js:
```
console.log("Background script loaded");

// Listen for when the extension icon is clicked
chrome.action.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
    console.log('Extension icon was clicked');

    // Get the active tab and change background to green
    chrome.tabs.query({active: true, currentWindow: true}, function(tabs) {
        if (tabs[0]) {
            chrome.scripting.executeScript({
                target: {tabId: tabs[0].id},
                func: () => {
                    document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'green';
                }
            });
        }
    });
});


```

Update Chrome Extension and visit google.com, AND THEN click the chrome extension. It should change Google page's background color.
