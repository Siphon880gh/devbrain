## Script, object, img

To enable loading any URL for `img-src` in Chrome extension development, you need to modify the Content Security Policy (CSP) in the extension's manifest file. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Open the `manifest.json` file** of your Chrome extension.

2. **Locate the `content_security_policy` key**. If it doesn't exist, you'll need to add it.

3. **Modify or add the `img-src` directive** to allow any URL. To do this, set its value to `'img-src * data:'`.

Here's an example of what the `content_security_policy` might look like:

```json
{
...
"content_security_policy": "script-src 'self' https://example.com; style-src 'self'; object-src 'self'; img-src * data:",
...
}
```


In this example:

- `script-src 'self';` allows scripts to be loaded from the extension itself. Note that manifest v3 doesn't allow remotely hosted scripts from loading anymore, so no point adding a domain.
- `style-src 'self' https://example.com;` allows css stylesheets to be loaded from the extension itself and `https://example.com`.
- `object-src 'self';` allows objects (like `<object>`, `<embed>`, and `<applet>` elements) to only load resources from the extension itself.
- `img-src * data:;` allows images to be loaded from any source and also allows inline images using the `data:` URI scheme like `<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVB...
- `connect-src 'self' https://example.com;` allows fetch to make API requests for JSON response, etc.

**Important Notes**:
- Modifying the CSP to allow any URL can introduce security risks. Only do this if you're sure about the sources from which you're loading content.
- Always follow the principle of least privilege. Only allow what you need and nothing more.
- If you're loading content from specific trusted domains, it's better to list those domains explicitly rather than using a wildcard `*`.
- After making changes to the `manifest.json` file, make sure to reload your extension in the Chrome Extensions page (`chrome://extensions/`) for the changes to take effect.

**Notes on connect-src:**
This `connect-src 'self' https://pokeapi.co;` at manifest.json, would allow for this fetch to run without being blocked:
```
fetch("https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/pikachu")  
  .then(response => response.json())  
  .then(data => console.log(data))  
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error))
```

## Default src

Keypoints:
- `default-src` applies to all resource types unless overridden by specific directives.
- Optional. If you don't provide a `default-src`, Chrome Extensions default to **`default-src 'self'`**, meaning no external content is allowed.

Example - Allow images from a specific external CDN but keep everything else restricted
```
{
  "content_security_policy": {
    "extension_pages": "default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' https://cdn.example.com;"
  }
}
```
