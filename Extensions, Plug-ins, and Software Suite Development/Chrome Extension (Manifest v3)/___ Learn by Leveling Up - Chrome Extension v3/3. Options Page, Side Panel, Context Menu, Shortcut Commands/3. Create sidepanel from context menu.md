## Setup

Create icon files set. You should know how by now.

Create manifest.json with these contents:
```
{  
    "manifest_version": 3,  
    "name": "<APP_NAME>",  
    "version": "1.0",  
    "description": "<APP_DESCRIPTION>.",  
    "author": "Weng Fei Fung",
    "icons": {  
        "16": "icon16x16.png",  
        "32": "icon32x32.png",  
        "48": "icon48x48.png",  
        "128": "icon128x128.png"  
    },
    "content_security_policy": {  
        "extension_pages": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; object-src 'self';"
    },
    "permissions": [
        "sidePanel", "contextMenus", "scripting", "tabs", "activeTab"
    ],
    "action": {  
        "default_icon": "icon.png"
    },
	"background": {
	    "service_worker": "background.js"
    },
    "side_panel": {
        "default_path": "sidepanel.html"
    }
}
```

Notice the "sidePanel" as a permission. Otherwise, side panel api would not be available for you to programmatically open the side panel.

Based on the manifest.json, we see that this is a function action (NOT a popup action), so no popup.html is needed.

We also see that there are two files we need to create:
- background.js
- sidepanel.html

Create background.js to detect the user **right-clicking** the chrome extension icon (for the function action):
```
console.log("Background script loaded");

chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
    chrome.contextMenus.create({
      id: 'openSidePanel',
      title: 'Open side panel',
      contexts: ['all']
    });
  });
  
  chrome.contextMenus.onClicked.addListener((info, tab) => {
    if (info.menuItemId === 'openSidePanel') {
      // This will open the panel in all the pages on the current window.
      chrome.sidePanel.open({ windowId: tab.windowId });
    }
});
```

^Then background.js opens the sidepanel programmatically.
^Upon context menu item being clicked, you have access to the menu item id as well as the tab you're at when accessing the chrome extension icon's context menu. You match the menu item id is as expected before proceeding. Then with the tab, you can extract the window id to open the side panel with (you pass window id into the method that opens the side panel).


Create sidepanel.html:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Options</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Side Panel</h1>
</body>

</html>
```

Update/install the chrome extension because we will do some preliminary testing next.

## Testing

Click the chrome extension icon. Thinking what happens under the hood:
- background.js detects onclick event of the chrome extension icon
- background.js then programmatically opens sidepanel (which is sidepanel.html)

Should look like:
- Right-clicked chrome extension icon -> Open side panel
  ![[Pasted image 20250326211015.png]]
- After clicking "Open side panel":
  ![[Pasted image 20250326211036.png]]

## Concern and Solution

For the user to access the main features of our chrome extension, they have to RIGHT-CLICK then select the proper menu item. They might not know that.

So you could have a Side panel action or an onclick to the extension icon, and that can open a popup informing the user (along with screenshots) OR you can make the left-click also open the sidebar.

Let's have left-click also open the sidebar. We add back some familiar code:
```
console.log("Background script loaded");

chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
    chrome.contextMenus.create({
      id: 'openSidePanel',
      title: 'Open side panel',
      contexts: ['all']
    });
  });
  
  chrome.contextMenus.onClicked.addListener((info, tab) => {
    if (info.menuItemId === 'openSidePanel') {
      // This will open the panel in all the pages on the current window.
      chrome.sidePanel.open({ windowId: tab.windowId });
    }
});

// Allows users to open the side panel by clicking on the action toolbar icon
chrome.sidePanel
  .setPanelBehavior({ openPanelOnActionClick: true })
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

Update the chrome extension. You'll see both left-click and right-click -> "Open side panel" both works.
