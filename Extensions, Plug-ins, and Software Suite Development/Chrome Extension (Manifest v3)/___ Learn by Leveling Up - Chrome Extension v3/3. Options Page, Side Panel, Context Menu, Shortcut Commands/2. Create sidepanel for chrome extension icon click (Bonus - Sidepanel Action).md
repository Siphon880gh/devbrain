## Setup

Create icon files set. You should know how by now.

Create manifest.json with these contents:
```
{  
    "manifest_version": 3,  
    "name": "<APP_NAME>",  
    "version": "1.0",  
    "description": "<APP_DESCRIPTION>.",  
    "author": "Weng Fei Fung",
    "icons": {  
        "16": "icon16x16.png",  
        "32": "icon32x32.png",  
        "48": "icon48x48.png",  
        "128": "icon128x128.png"  
    },
    "content_security_policy": {  
        "extension_pages": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; object-src 'self';"
    },
    "permissions": [
        "sidePanel", "scripting", "tabs", "activeTab"
    ],
    "action": {  
        "default_icon": "icon.png"
    },
	"background": {
	    "service_worker": "background.js"
    },
    "side_panel": {
        "default_path": "sidepanel.html"
    }
}
```

Notice we added "sidePanel" as a permission. Otherwise, side panel api would not be available for you to programmatically open the side panel.

Based on the manifest.json, we see that this is a function action (NOT a popup action), so no popup.html is needed.

We also see that there are two files we need to create:
- background.js
- sidepanel.html

Create `background.js` to detect the user clicking the chrome extension icon (for the function action):
```
console.log("Background script loaded");

// Listen for when the extension icon is clicked
chrome.action.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
    console.log('Extension icon was clicked');
    chrome.sidePanel.open({ windowId: tab.windowId });
});
```

^Then background.js opens the sidepanel programmatically.
^Background detects the chrome extension icon is clicked, and is able to provide information on which tab you're on when the chrome extension is clicked. With the tab object, you can extract the window id to open the side panel with (you pass window id into the method that opens the side panel).

Create sidepanel.html:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Options</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Side Panel</h1>
</body>

</html>
```

Update/install the chrome extension because we will do some preliminary testing next.

## Preliminary Testing

Click the chrome extension icon. Thinking what happens under the hood:
- background.js detects onclick event of the chrome extension icon
- background.js then programmatically opens sidepanel (which is sidepanel.html)

Click the Chrome Extension:
![[Pasted image 20250326211520.png]]

You can close the sidepanel by clicking the sidepanel icon that's now active or by clicking the "X" at the top right inside the sidepanel. Clicking the chrome extension icon does not toggle the sidepanel away (the click action is always to open sidepanel)

As of 3/2025, Google does not provide an option to check for sidepanel is visible or to have a method toggling the sidepanel. You think about using storage, but there's no way to switch the boolean flag when user exists the side panel by clicking the X or sidepanel icon (instead of the extension icon).

## Sidepanel Action (Toggle sidepanel with chrome extension icon)


But if you've configured the action to be a Sidepanel Action, clicking the chrome extension icon will toggle sidepanel

Modify background.js to:
```
console.log("Background script loaded");

// Allows users to open the side panel by clicking on the action toolbar icon
chrome.sidePanel
  .setPanelBehavior({ openPanelOnActionClick: true })
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

This is easier to remember and conceptually easier to code (Code roughly translate to English as: sidePanel to open when user clicked extension is true). 

However, you can't have other code running at the same time as when the opening of the sidebar happens. In the `chrome.action.onClicked.addListener`, you could write as many lines of code execution you want.

## Summary

In summary, we covered two ways to open the sidebar in Chrome Extension development, and have discussed their pro's and con's.
