In the provided example, the content_security_policy is defined as follows:

```
"content_security_policy": "default-src 'self' https://tradingview.com/ https://platform.openai.com; script-src 'self', object-src 'self'",
"extension_pages": "script-src 'self'; object-src 'self';"
```

Here, the default-src directive permits resources from the extension's own domain ('self'), in addition to resources from https://tradingview.com/ and https://platform.openai.com. It serves as a fallback for other directives like img-src that are not explicitly set, ensuring a secure default behavior.

The script-src and object-src directives are restrictive, allowing scripts and objects, respectively, only from the extension's own domain ('self'). The object-src directive specifically governs the valid sources for plugins, such as <object> and <embed> elements.

Further, the connect-src directive outlines the legitimate sources for network connections initiated through methods like XMLHttpRequest, fetch(), and WebSocket. It allows connections specifically to https://api.openai.com/.

The style-src directive is configured to allow inline styles and styles from the extension's own domain ('self'), while the frame-src directive permits frames exclusively from https://www.tradingview.com/. Additionally, the frame-ancestors directive enables the extension's popup to be embedded in a frame within the extension's own domain ('self').

Pitfall:
It is crucial to ensure that your <a> tags explicitly specify https or http, and this explicitness should be mirrored in the manifest.json. However, it's important to note that 'self' does not necessitate a specific protocol like https or http and can adapt to either.
