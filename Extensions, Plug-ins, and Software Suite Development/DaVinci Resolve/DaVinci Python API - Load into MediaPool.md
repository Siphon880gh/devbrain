## Be familiar with the issue of automatic assembling based on filename pattern

If you imported images like this:

```
image_files = [
    "/Users/wengffung/Downloads/DaVinci Assets 2/clip01.jpg",
    "/Users/wengffung/Downloads/DaVinci Assets 2/clip02.jpg",
    "/Users/wengffung/Downloads/DaVinci Assets 2/clip03.jpg",
    "/Users/wengffung/Downloads/DaVinci Assets 2/clip04.jpg",
    "/Users/wengffung/Downloads/DaVinci Assets 2/clip05.jpg",
    "/Users/wengffung/Downloads/DaVinci Assets 2/clip06.jpg",
    "/Users/wengffung/Downloads/DaVinci Assets 2/clip07.jpg"

```

Or you drag and drop those files into the Media Pool Panel 

What actually gets imported into the Media Pool will be:
```
clip[01-02]
clip[04-05]
clip07
```

This is because DaVinci is assuming you want to automatically assemble such named assets into clips based on the filenaming with suffixed numerical sequence. 

Reworded: The inconsistency you're experiencing is due to DaVinci Resolve automatically detecting and grouping sequentially numbered images as image sequences. When images like `clip01.jpg`, `clip02.jpg`, etc., are imported, Resolve assumes they are frames of a video sequence and groups them into a single clip in the Media Pool. This is why you see entries like `clip[01-02].jpg` or `clip[04-05].jpg`.

For your use case, this is either a needed feature or a nuance. The problem or feature extends into the coding that loads assets into media pool, not just a problem when manually importing the files through the DaVinci UI.

Thus here are different scenarios  with snippets of importing into the Media Pool and whether or not you want this feature
