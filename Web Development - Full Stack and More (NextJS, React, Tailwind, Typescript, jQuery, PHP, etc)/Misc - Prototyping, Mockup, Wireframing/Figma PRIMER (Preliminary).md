Aka: Get Started

Hi, my team uses Figma for UI design and testing prototypes with users. We love it. The collaborative nature allows for rapid iteration between team members. The component features make it so easy to play with the design and quickly build realistic user testing scenarios solely with the design team. With the prototyping feature, we can almost fully test a prototype without a line of code written. We are more easily able to communicate the design to our developer -- the css can be extracted either automatically or by inspecting individual objects. I think Figma has also helped build trust with our customers. We look professional!

Weaknesses: the components can be a little tricky -- e.g., the text in a button can become misaligned (drives designers crazy!) -- if you don't build the them properly. The flexibility easily allows for designs that could require advance UI dev. There is a learning curve to utilize the components feature.

Coolest thing we have done: user tested our redesigned data search page with the prototyping features.
