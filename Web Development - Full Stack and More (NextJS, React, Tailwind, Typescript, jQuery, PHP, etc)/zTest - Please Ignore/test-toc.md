## Introduction

  

This document contains various heading levels to test the numbering and indentation system.

  

### Purpose

  

The purpose of this test is to ensure that:

  

#### Numbering Works Correctly

- H1 items are numbered as 1., 2., 3., etc.

- H2 items are numbered as 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, etc.

- H3 items are numbered as 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.2.1, etc.

  

##### Indentation Works Properly

- Each heading level is properly indented

- The hierarchy is visually clear

- Left alignment works correctly

  

###### Scrolling Functionality

- Long content can be scrolled

- Panel height is appropriate

##### Sub-sub-subsection 1.1.1

  

This is an even deeper level to test the full hierarchy.

  

###### Deepest Level 1.1.1.1

  

This is the deepest level to test all six heading levels.

  

#### Sub-subsection 1.2

  

Another sub-subsection to test multiple items at the same level.

  

### Subsection 2

  

This is the second subsection under the main content.

  

#### Sub-subsection 2.1

  

Testing multiple subsections under different main sections.

  

##### Sub-sub-subsection 2.1.1

  

Another deep level test.

  

## Another Main Section

  

This is another main section to test multiple H1 items.

  

### Another Subsection

  

This subsection tests the numbering reset for new H1 items.

  

#### Another Sub-subsection

## Conclusion

  

This test document should demonstrate:

1. Proper numbering for all heading levels

2. Correct indentation for each level

3. Left-aligned text in the TOC panel

4. Proper scrolling when content is long

5. Clear visual hierarchy

  

The table of contents should show all these headings with proper numbering and indentation when the TOC button is clicked.
