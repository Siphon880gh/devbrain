When does it make sense to make an app able to install as a PWA? Otherwise, you may waste engineering hours if you a website a PWA for no reason.
### When a PWA **makes sense**:

|Use Case|Why PWA Helps|
|---|---|
|**News Sites / Blogs**|Offline reading, faster repeat visits via caching|
|**E-commerce**|Faster browsing, offline cart, re-engagement with push notifications|
|**Social Platforms**|Mobile app-like experience, user retention via home screen access|
|**Tools / Dashboards**|Frequent use, installability improves convenience|
|**Travel / Booking Apps**|Offline itinerary access, push alerts, fast search results|

### When a PWA **doesn’t make sense**:

|Use Case|Why It’s Overkill|
|---|---|
|**Static landing pages**|No frequent interaction; caching not critical|
|**Corporate brochure sites**|No engagement loop; low return visits|
|**One-time campaign microsites**|Short-lived; no install value|
|**Highly dynamic content (without offline need)**|Data may be outdated if cached poorly|
|**SEO-only content farms**|Caching + offline doesn’t serve the goal of one-time discovery|

Implementing a PWA just for the sake of it doesn’t always provide ROI. It’s more useful when your users **return frequently**, **expect app-like performance**, or **benefit from offline capabilities.**
