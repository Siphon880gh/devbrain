### Understanding `start_url` and `scope` in PWA's `manifest.json`

#### **What `start_url` Does**
The `start_url` specifies the initial URL the Progressive Web App (PWA) should open when launched, such as from a shortcut on the device's home screen. For example:

```json
"start_url": "/app/image-gallery-nft-collab/"
```

When the user launches the app via a home screen icon, the browser navigates directly to this URL, providing a consistent starting point for the PWA.

#### **What `scope` Does**
The `scope` defines the set of URLs that the PWA can control and ensures it operates within its standalone app environment (without the browserâ€™s UI). For example:

```json
"scope": "/app/image-gallery-nft-collab/"
```

This configuration means:

- URLs within the defined scope (e.g., `/app/image-gallery-nft-collab/page1` or `/app/image-gallery-nft-collab/settings`) remain under the PWA's control and preserve the app-like experience.
- If the user navigates to a URL outside this scope, the app exits the standalone PWA environment and loads the page in a regular browser tab. 

By carefully setting the `scope`, you can ensure the PWA behaves as intended and maintains a seamless app experience within defined boundaries.
