## ðŸ§ª Free API Mocking Services for Developers

API mocking services allow developers to easily simulate real APIsâ€”either by using predefined fake data generators or by defining custom datasets.

### Why is this important?

Because it **unblocks your frontend team**. Instead of waiting on the backend to finish building an API, developers can hit a mock endpoint with realistic data and start building features right away. This speeds up development, reduces dependencies, and enables better parallel collaboration between frontend and backend teams.

Whether you're testing UI components, prototyping workflows, or building early-stage products, here are the best **free API mocking tools** to get you started:
