## üìå **Yarn vs NPM: A Comparison**

Yarn and NPM are the two most popular package managers for JavaScript projects, and they are in a **tight race** when it comes to **features, speed, and dependency management**. At one point, **Yarn was ahead** of NPM in terms of performance and features, but NPM has since caught up.

### üîπ **Similarities Between Yarn & NPM**

- **Both use `package.json`** for project dependencies.
- **Both have a lock file**:
    - `package-lock.json` (NPM)
    - `yarn.lock` (Yarn)
- **Both can run scripts** defined in `package.json`:
    - `npm run SCRIPT`
    - `yarn run SCRIPT`
- **Both allow global installations** (`-g` for NPM, `global` for Yarn).
- **Both support workspaces for monorepos**.

## ‚ö° **Key Differences Between Yarn & NPM**

|Feature|Yarn|NPM|
|---|---|---|
|**Installation Command**|`yarn add <package>`|`npm install <package>`|
|**Version Lock File**|`yarn.lock`|`package-lock.json`|
|**Install Dependencies**|`yarn install`|`npm install`|
|**Install a Specific Version**|`yarn add package@1.2.3`|`npm install package@1.2.3`|
|**Remove a Package**|`yarn remove <package>`|`npm uninstall <package>`|
|**Global Package Install**|`yarn global add <package>`|`npm install -g <package>`|
|**Cache Efficiency**|Uses a local offline cache|Redownloads on each install (though improved with `npm ci`)|
|**Speed**|Generally faster due to parallel installation|Slower than Yarn but improved in NPM v7+|
|**Workspaces**|Built-in support|Added in NPM v7+|
|**Security Checks**|`yarn audit`|`npm audit`|

## üõ†Ô∏è **Choosing Between Yarn & NPM**

### ‚úÖ **Use Yarn if:**

- You want **faster** and **more reliable** installs.
- You prefer **automatic offline caching** (installs from cache instead of downloading again).
- You're working in a **monorepo** (Yarn workspaces are very useful).

### ‚úÖ **Use NPM if:**

- You want **default support with Node.js** (no need to install Yarn separately).
- You're using **newer versions of NPM (v7+)**, which have improved speed and workspace support.
- You prefer **better integration with the JavaScript ecosystem** (NPM is the default for most projects).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do Not Use Both NPM and Yarn in the Same Project**

Mixing **NPM** and **Yarn** in the same project **can cause dependency conflicts, unexpected behavior, and inconsistencies** in package management.

### ‚ùå **Why You Shouldn't Use Both NPM & Yarn**

1. **Conflicting Lock Files**
    
    - **NPM** uses `package-lock.json`
    - **Yarn** uses `yarn.lock`  
        If both exist, it can confuse dependency resolution, causing different package versions in different environments.
2. **Inconsistent Dependency Resolution**
    
    - Yarn and NPM **resolve versions differently**.
    - If you switch between them, you may get **different package versions**, leading to unexpected bugs.
3. **Duplicate `node_modules` Issues**
    
    - Some dependencies may be **installed differently** by Yarn vs NPM, causing conflicts inside `node_modules`.
    - This may break your project or cause subtle errors.
4. **Confusion for Team Members & CI/CD**
    
    - If some developers use **NPM** and others use **Yarn**, package versions may differ, leading to **"works on my machine"** issues.
    - CI/CD pipelines may also fail due to lockfile conflicts.

yarn vs npm

The choice between npm and Yarn as package managers depends on several factors, and both tools have their own strengths and considerations. Here are some points to consider when deciding between npm and Yarn:

Advantages of npm:
Default package manager: npm is the default package manager for Node.js, which means it comes bundled with Node.js installation. This makes it convenient if you want to use the default tooling provided by the Node.js ecosystem.
Larger package registry: npm has been around for a longer time and has a larger package registry, which means you are more likely to find a wide range of packages for your project's needs.
Simplicity: npm has a straightforward and simple interface, making it easy to learn and use for basic package management tasks.

Advantages of Yarn:
Faster and efficient: Yarn was introduced to address some performance issues with npm. Yarn parallelizes package installations, which can lead to faster and more efficient dependency resolution and installation.
Deterministic dependency resolution: Yarn uses a lockfile (yarn.lock) to ensure deterministic dependency resolution. This means that every developer working on the project will have the same versions of dependencies installed, reducing the likelihood of dependency-related issues.

Improved caching: Yarn has better caching mechanisms compared to npm, which can be beneficial when working on large projects or in scenarios where you frequently switch between different projects.
Workspaces: Yarn provides a feature called "workspaces" that allows you to manage multiple packages within a single repository. This can be helpful for monorepo setups or projects with complex interdependencies.

Ultimately, the choice between npm and Yarn depends on your specific needs and preferences. If you prioritize performance, deterministic dependency management, and efficient caching, Yarn may be a good fit. On the other hand, if you prefer simplicity and compatibility with the Node.js ecosystem by default, npm might be a suitable choice. Both tools are actively maintained and widely used, so you can select the one that aligns best with your project requirements.
