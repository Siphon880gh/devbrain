Npm doubles as both a package manager (installs dependencies) and as a task runner tool (automates executing repetitive tasks in dev workflow including building, testing, deploying).

As a package manager we have `npm install`, `npm uninstall ..`, `npm audit fix`, etc

As a task runner tool, we have `npm run start`, `npm start`, `npm run build` etc etc
