AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) is a specific type of module definition pattern in JavaScript. Here's how it differs from other popular module systems:

AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition):

Primary Use: Designed for the browser.
Key Feature: Asynchronous loading of modules.
Example: RequireJS is a popular AMD module loader.
Syntax: Uses define for defining modules and require for loading them.
Characteristics: Modules are loaded asynchronously, which is beneficial for web applications where modules and their dependencies are loaded on-demand, reducing initial load times.
