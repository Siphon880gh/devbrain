Across nearly every programming language—JavaScript, Node.js, Python, etc.—you’ll see **Unix time** and **UTC** used constantly when working with dates.

**Unix time** is the number of **seconds** since **January 1, 1970 (UTC)**—known as the **Unix Epoch**. It’s a universal baseline for timestamps.

In JavaScript:

```js
Date.now(); 
// ✅ Gets current time in UTC — in **milliseconds** since Unix Epoch

Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000); 
// ✅ Converts to **Unix timestamp** — in **seconds**
```

In Python:

```python
import time
time.time()  
# ✅ Returns Unix time in seconds (float)
```

**TL;DR:**  
Unix time is a UTC-based count of seconds (or milliseconds).  
It’s a language-agnostic way to store and manipulate time across systems and databases. You’ll run into it often—so know how to work with it.

**MongoDb/Mongoose**

MongoDB and Mongoose stores dates in **UTC** by default.
