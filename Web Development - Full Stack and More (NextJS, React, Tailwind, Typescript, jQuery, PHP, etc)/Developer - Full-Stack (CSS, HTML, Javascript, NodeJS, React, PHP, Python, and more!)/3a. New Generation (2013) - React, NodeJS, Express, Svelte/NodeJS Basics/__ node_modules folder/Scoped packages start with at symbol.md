In `node_modules/` , there are folders named with "@". These folders represent **scoped packages**. These scopes are often used by organizations or individual authors to group related packages.

For example, if you see:
```
node_modules/  
├── @supabase/  
│   ├── auth-helpers  
│   ├── gotrue-js  
│   ├── storage-js  
│   └── supabase-js  
└── express/
```

**This means:**
- All packages inside `@supabase/` are published under the **Supabase** organization (or user scope).
- These packages are namespaced under `@supabase`, so they are installed as:
	```
	npm install @supabase/supabase-js  
	```
- When importing them in code, you use:
	```
	import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
	```

**Why Use Scoped Packages?**
- **Branding & Ownership**: Ensures packages from the same author are clearly grouped.
- **Avoid Name Clashes**: Two different authors could have a package called `utils`, but `@org/utils` prevents conflicts.
- **Access Control**: Organizations can manage access to scoped packages on private NPM registries.
