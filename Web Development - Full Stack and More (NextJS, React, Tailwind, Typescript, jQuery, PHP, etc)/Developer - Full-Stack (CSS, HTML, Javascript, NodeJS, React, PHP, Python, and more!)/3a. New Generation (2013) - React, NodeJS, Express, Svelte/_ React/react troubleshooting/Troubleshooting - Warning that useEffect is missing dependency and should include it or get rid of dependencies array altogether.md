Text: Warning that useEffect is missing dependency and should include it or get rid of dependencies array altogether

The dependency array tells React when to re-run the effect. If the array is empty (`[]`), the effect will only run once, on the initial render. If the array contains values (`[dep1, dep2]`), the effect will re-run whenever any of those values change.

The error you're seeing means that React has detected that you're using a value (`fetchBusinesses`) inside the `useEffect` callback, but you haven't included it in the dependency array. This can lead to stale closures and unexpected behavior.

To fix the issue, you have two options:

1. **Include the missing dependency in the array**:

```
useEffect(() => {
	fetchBusinesses();
}, [fetchBusinesses]);
```

By adding `fetchBusinesses` to the dependency array, React will re-run the effect whenever the `fetchBusinesses` function changes (e.g., when the component re-renders).

2. **Remove the dependency by wrapping the function in a `useCallback` hook**:


```
const fetchBusinessesCallback = useCallback(() => {
	fetchBusinesses();
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
	fetchBusinessesCallback();
}, [fetchBusinessesCallback]);
```

In this approach, you create a memoized version of the `fetchBusinesses` function using `useCallback`. The `useCallback` hook returns a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. Since there are no dependencies in the `useCallback` hook's dependency array, the memoized version of `fetchBusinessesCallback` will never change, and you can safely add it to the `useEffect`'s dependency array.

The choice between the two options depends on your specific use case. If you want the effect to re-run whenever `fetchBusinesses` changes, go with the first option. If you only want the effect to run once and don't need to re-run it when `fetchBusinesses` changes, the second option with `useCallback` is a better choice.

Remember, the dependency array in `useEffect` ensures that your effects are consistent and avoids bugs caused by stale closures or missed effect re-runs.
