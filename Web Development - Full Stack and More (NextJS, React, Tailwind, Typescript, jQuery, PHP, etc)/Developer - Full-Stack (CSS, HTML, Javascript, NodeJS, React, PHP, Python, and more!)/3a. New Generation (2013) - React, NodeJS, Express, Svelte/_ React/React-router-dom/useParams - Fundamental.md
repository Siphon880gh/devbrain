In React Router dom component routes, how to have a placeholder like in express /locations/:locationId

\>>
In react-router-dom, you can specify route parameters in a similar way to Express.js, with a colon `:` followed by the name of the parameter. For instance, if you're creating a route to a specific location by its ID, you might define the Route component as follows:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <Router>
            <Route path="/locations/:locationId" component={LocationComponent} />
        </Router>
    );
}

export default App;
```

In the above example, `:locationId` is the placeholder for any id which will be part of the URL.

Now, inside the `LocationComponent`, you can access this `locationId` parameter using the `useParams` hook provided by react-router-dom:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

const LocationComponent = () => {
    let { locationId } = useParams();

    // now you can use this locationId to fetch data or perform any action

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Location ID: {locationId}</h1>
        </div>
    );
}

export default LocationComponent;
```

In this example, the `useParams` hook returns an object of key/value pairs of URL parameters. You can then use these parameters in your component. Here, it's being used to display the locationId, but you could also use it to fetch data based on this ID.
