While both Apollo Client (for GraphQL) and React Query has useQuery and useMutation - no - Apollo Client does not use React Query under the hood. 

While Apollo Client and React Query offer similar functionalities in managing asynchronous data operations and state in a React application, they are distinct libraries with different focuses and design philosophies. Both libraries use hooks to fetch and mutate data, which might explain why their syntax seems similar.

Here are some key differences and similarities between the two:

1. **Core Focus:**
   - **Apollo Client:** Specifically designed for interacting with GraphQL APIs. It provides a comprehensive solution for fetching, caching, and managing GraphQL data in a client-side application.
   - **React Query:** A more general data-fetching library that can be used with any type of backend or API. It's not limited to GraphQL and can handle REST, GraphQL, or even no-backend setups.

2. **Query Syntax:**
   - Both libraries use hooks to fetch and mutate data, which might explain why their syntax seems similar. However, the way you define queries and mutations differs due to their different focuses (GraphQL vs. general data fetching).

3. **Caching:**
   - **Apollo Client:** Has a more sophisticated caching mechanism tailored for GraphQL. It normalizes and caches query results by their individual objects, making it very efficient for GraphQL operations where data can be deeply nested and interconnected.
   - **React Query:** Provides powerful caching capabilities but does not normalize data like Apollo. It caches the entire query result and associates it with a unique query key.

4. **Community and Ecosystem:**
   - **Apollo Client:** Part of the larger Apollo ecosystem, which provides various tools specifically for GraphQL, including server-side tools.
   - **React Query:** Standalone library focused on data fetching and caching, with a strong community and growing ecosystem.

5. **Usage:**
   - If you are working exclusively with GraphQL, Apollo Client is typically the go-to choice because of its integrated ecosystem and GraphQL-specific optimizations.
   - If you need a flexible data-fetching library that isn't tied to GraphQL or you're dealing with various kinds of APIs in the same project, React Query might be more suitable.

In summary, while Apollo Client and React Query might offer similar hook-based APIs for data fetching and mutation, they are different tools designed for different purposes, and they do not share underlying implementations.

## Forced Compatibility

You can still use both libraries if you rename their useState and useMutation hooks:
```
// Importing from Apollo import { useQuery as useApolloQuery, useMutation as useApolloMutation } from '@apollo/client'; // Importing from React Query import { useQuery as useReactQuery, useMutation as useReactMutation } from 'react-query';
```
