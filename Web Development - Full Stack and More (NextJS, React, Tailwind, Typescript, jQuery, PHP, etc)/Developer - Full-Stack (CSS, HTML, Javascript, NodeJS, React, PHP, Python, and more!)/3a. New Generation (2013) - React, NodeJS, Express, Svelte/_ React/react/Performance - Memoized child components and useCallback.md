In React, memoization is a way to cache the result of a component's render, so that if the props haven't changed, the component won't re-render unnecessarily, improving performance.

When you wrap a component with `React.memo`, you're creating a memoized version of that component. Here's how it works:

```jsx
const MemoizedChild = React.memo(Child);
```

The `React.memo` higher-order component takes a component as an argument and returns a new memoized version of that component. The memoized component will skip re-rendering if its props haven't changed (based on a shallow equality check) since the last render.

However, if the child component receives a function as a prop, the memoization won't work as expected because a new function instance is created on every render of the parent component, even if the function's logic hasn't changed. This is where `useCallback` and `useEffect` come into play.

**Using `useCallback`**:

```jsx
const Parent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, [count]);

  return <MemoizedChild handleClick={handleClick} />;
};
```

By using `useCallback`, you're memoizing the `handleClick` function, so it will only be recreated when the `count` dependency changes. This way, when the `Parent` component re-renders, the memoized `MemoizedChild` component will receive the same `handleClick` function reference and won't re-render unnecessarily.

**Using `useEffect`**:

```jsx
const Parent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleClick = () => {
      setCount(count + 1);
    };

    // Pass the handleClick function to the MemoizedChild component
  }, [count]);

  return <MemoizedChild handleClick={handleClick} />;
};
```

Here, the `handleClick` function is recreated inside the `useEffect` hook whenever the `count` dependency changes. Since the memoized `MemoizedChild` component receives a new `handleClick` function reference only when `count` changes, it will avoid unnecessary re-renders.

In both cases, the `MemoizedChild` component is a memoized child component, and `useCallback` or `useEffect` is used to ensure that the function prop passed to the memoized child component only changes when necessary, allowing the memoization to work as expected and preventing unnecessary re-renders.

So, in summary, yes, these examples demonstrate the use of memoized child components in React, where memoization is used in combination with `useCallback` or `useEffect` to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
