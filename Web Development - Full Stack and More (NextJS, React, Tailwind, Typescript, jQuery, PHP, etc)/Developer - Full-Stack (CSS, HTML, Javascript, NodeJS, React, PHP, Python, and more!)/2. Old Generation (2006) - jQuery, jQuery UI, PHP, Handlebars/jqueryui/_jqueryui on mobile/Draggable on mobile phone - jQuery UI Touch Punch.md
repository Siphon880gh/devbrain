To enable dragging and repositioning of elements on mobile devices using jQuery UI, you can use the `touch-punch` library. jQuery UI does not natively support touch events, but `touch-punch` is a small library that translates touch events into mouse events, allowing jQuery UI interactions to work on touch devices.

Here's how you can implement it:

1. **Include jQuery and jQuery UI**: Make sure you have included jQuery and jQuery UI in your project.

2. **Include jQuery UI Touch Punch**: Add the jQuery UI Touch Punch library to your project. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/furf/jquery-ui-touch-punch) or include it via a CDN.

3. **Initialize Draggable Elements**: Use jQuery UI's `draggable` method to make elements draggable.

Here's an example of how you can set this up:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Draggable Example</title>
    <!-- Include jQuery -->
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
    <!-- Include jQuery UI -->
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.13.2/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>
    <!-- Include jQuery UI Touch Punch -->
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui-touch-punch/0.2.3/jquery.ui.touch-punch.min.js"></script>
    <style>
        #draggable {
            width: 100px;
            height: 100px;
            background-color: #f00;
            color: #fff;
            text-align: center;
            line-height: 100px;
            position: absolute;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

<div id="draggable">Drag me</div>

<script>
    $(function() {
        $("#draggable").draggable();
    });
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation:

- **jQuery and jQuery UI**: These libraries are necessary for using the `draggable` functionality.
- **jQuery UI Touch Punch**: This library translates touch events into mouse events, enabling touch support for jQuery UI interactions.
- **Draggable Initialization**: The `$("#draggable").draggable();` line initializes the element with the ID `draggable` to be draggable.

By following these steps, you should be able to drag and reposition elements on both desktop and mobile devices.

## All you need is the library

Yes, including the jQuery UI Touch Punch library is typically all you need to enable touch support for jQuery UI interactions like draggable, resizable, sortable, and selectable. The library works by converting touch events into mouse events, so no additional JavaScript configuration is usually necessary beyond what you would normally do for jQuery UI.
