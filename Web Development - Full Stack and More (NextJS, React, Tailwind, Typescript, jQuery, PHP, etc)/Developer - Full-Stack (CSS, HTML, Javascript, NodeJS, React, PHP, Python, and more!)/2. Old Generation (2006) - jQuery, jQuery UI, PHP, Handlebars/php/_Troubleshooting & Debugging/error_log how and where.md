The location of the `error_log` file and how to access it depends on your server setup and PHP configuration. Here's how to find and view it:

### 1. **PHP Configuration**:

You can find out where PHP is logging errors by checking the `php.ini` file for the `error_log` directive. This directive specifies the path of the error log.

To find out the path via a PHP script:

```php
<?php
echo ini_get('error_log');
?>
```

Run this script through your web server, and it should print the path to your error log.

### 2. **Common Locations**:

If you're using a standard setup like a LAMP stack:

- **Shared Hosting**: On shared hosts, the error logs are often available in your hosting control panel (like cPanel). Look for a section called "Error Logs" or something similar.
  
- **Local Development Environment (e.g., XAMPP, MAMP)**:
  - **XAMPP**: `C:\xampp\php\logs\php_error_log` (Windows) or `/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/logs/php_error_log` (Mac)
  - **MAMP**: `/Applications/MAMP/logs/php_error.log`

- **Dedicated/VPS Hosting**: If you have root access, logs might be in a directory like `/var/log/`. Apache logs can often be found in `/var/log/apache2/` and Nginx logs in `/var/log/nginx/`.

### 3. **Viewing the Log**:

Once you've located the error log:

- If you have SSH access to the server, you can use commands like `cat`, `less`, or `tail` to view the log. For example:

  ```bash
  tail -f /path/to/error_log
  ```

  The above command will show the last few lines of the log and update in real-time.

- If you don't have SSH access, you can download the log file via FTP or through your hosting control panel and then view it with any text editor.

### 4. **Custom Error Log Location**:

If you want to set a custom location for the error log, you can do so in the `php.ini`:

```ini
error_log = /path/to/custom_error_log.log
```

After making changes to `php.ini`, remember to restart your web server for the changes to take effect.

### Recommendations:

Always ensure that your error log is protected and not accessible to the public, as it can contain sensitive information. If you're not sure about the location or how to access the error log, you can also reach out to your hosting provider or system administrator for assistance.
