We'll assume the data passed to the template includes an artist object and a tracks array.

```html
<script id="songListTemplate" type="text/x-handlebars-template">
    <p>Top tracks for {{artist.name}} on Spotify:</p>
    <ul>
        {{#each tracks}}
        <li>{{this.name}}</li>
        {{/each}}
    </ul>
</script>
```

In this template:
- `{{artist.name}}` is used to display the artist's name, assuming the artist data is provided in an `artist` object.
- The `{{#each tracks}}` block iterates over an array of tracks, and `{{this.name}}` accesses the name of each track.

### Example Data Structure:

Here's how you could structure the data passed to this template:

```json
{
    "artist": {
        "name": "Artist Name"
    },
    "tracks": [
        {
            "name": "Track 1"
        },
        {
            "name": "Track 2"
        },
        {
            "name": "Track 3"
        }
    ]
}
```

This data structure includes:
- An `artist` object with a `name` property.
- A `tracks` array where each element is an object representing a track, with each having a `name` property.

Given the Handlebars template and the example data structure provided, let's illustrate what the HTML rendered result would look like if we were to inject the data into the template. We'll use the example data with the artist name as "Artist Name" and three tracks named "Track 1", "Track 2", and "Track 3".

```html
<p>Top tracks for Artist Name on Spotify:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Track 1</li>
    <li>Track 2</li>
    <li>Track 3</li>
</ul>
```

This HTML snippet is the result of applying the data to the template. It presents a paragraph stating the artist's name followed by an unordered list of the tracks. Each track is listed as a list item (`<li>`) within the `<ul>` element.
