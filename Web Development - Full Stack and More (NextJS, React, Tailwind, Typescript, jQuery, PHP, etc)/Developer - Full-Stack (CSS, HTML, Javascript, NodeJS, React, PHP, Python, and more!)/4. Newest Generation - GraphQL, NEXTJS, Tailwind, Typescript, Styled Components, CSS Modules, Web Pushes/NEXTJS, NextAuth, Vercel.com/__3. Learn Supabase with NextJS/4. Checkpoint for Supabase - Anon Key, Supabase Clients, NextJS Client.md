## Checkpoint 1 - Anon Key

Anon key works with client side with limited permissions however adding Authentication policies at supabase.com allows elevated permissions.

## Checkpoint 2 - Browser and Server Supabase Clients

For your code to interface with Supabase, you have to initialize a Supabase client. For each page that connects to Supabase, you'll have to initialize it again.

There are two types of clients that is specific to whether you are on a browser component or server component:
- Browser Supabase client
- Server Supabase client

**Browser client** (`utils/supabase/client.ts`):

```
import { createBrowserClient } from "@supabase/ssr";

export const createClient = () =>
createBrowserClient(
	process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
	process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
);
```

**Server client** (`utils/supabase/server.ts`):
```
import { createServerClient } from "@supabase/ssr";
import { cookies } from "next/headers";

export const createClient = async () => {
	const cookieStore = await cookies();
	return createServerClient(
		process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
		process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
		{
		   cookies: {
			 get() { return cookieStore.get(); },
			 set(name, value, options) { cookieStore.set(name, value, options); }
		   }
		});
};
```

## Checkpoint 3 - The confusing word "Client"

On NextJS, adding `"use client"` at the first line makes the component a frontend browser component, and adding `"use server"` instead makes the component a server component.

However, when it comes to Supabase's "@supabase/ssr", you create a server **client** with `createServerClient` or you create a browser **client** with `createBrowserClient`.

So you can create a Supabase server client for a server component, and you may have `"use server"` instead of `"use client"` as first line of the NextJS component code.

Therefore:
- Client in NextJS world means frontend browser component.
- Client in Supabase means either browser or server initialization of Supabase.
