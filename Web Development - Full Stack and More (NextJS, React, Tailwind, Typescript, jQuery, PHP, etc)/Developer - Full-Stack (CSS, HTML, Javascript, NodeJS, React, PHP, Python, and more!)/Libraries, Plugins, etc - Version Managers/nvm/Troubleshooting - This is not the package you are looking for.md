**PROBLEM:**
Running `nvm` command errors with:
```
This is not the package you are looking for: please go to http://nvm.sh
```

**SOLUTION:**
**Donâ€™t install `nvm` via `npm`.** If you did, uninstall it with:
```
npm uninstall -g nvm
```

I ran into issues because I mistakenly installed `nvm` through `npm`. The fix was to remove that version using the command above.

After that, reinstall `nvm` using one of the proper methods (like the install script from the official repo). This ensures the correct version is installed and the path is set properly.
