In CSS, if you want to select elements that do not have a specific attribute, you can use the `:not()` pseudo-class in combination with the attribute selector. Hereâ€™s the general syntax for selecting elements that do not have a specific attribute:

```css
element:not([attribute]) {
  /* styles */
}
```

For example, if you want to style all `<div>` elements that do not have the `id` attribute, you would write:

```css
div:not([id]) {
  /* styles */
}
```

This CSS rule applies styles to any `<div>` elements that do not have an `id` attribute.
