If you want a vertical gradient that starts with fully transparent black at the top (0%), becomes 25% opaque black at the 25% mark, and then 50% opaque black at the 50% mark (remaining 50% opaque black for the rest of the gradient), you would set it up as follows:

```css
.gradient-opacity-black {
    background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0,0,0,0) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,0.25) 25%, rgba(0,0,0,0.5) 50%);
}
```

Here's a breakdown:

- `rgba(0,0,0,0) 0%` sets the gradient to start at the top with fully transparent black.
- `rgba(0,0,0,0.25) 25%` sets the gradient to be 25% opaque black at the 25% mark.
- `rgba(0,0,0,0.5) 50%` sets the gradient to be 50% opaque black at the 50% mark, and this opacity continues until the end (or unless another stop is added).

Apply the `.gradient-opacity-black` class to any element to give it this background gradient.
