Just think always equal or less than -VS- equal or greater than. Always has an equal.

1. `min-width`: This is used to apply styles when the viewport is at least a certain width. For instance, `@media (min-width: 600px) {...}` means the styles inside will apply when the viewport **is** 600 pixels **or wider.** This is often used for progressive enhancement, where you start with a basic design for smaller screens and then enhance it for larger screens.

  

2. `max-width`: This is used to apply styles when the viewport is at most a certain width. For example, `@media (max-width: 599px) {...}` means the styles inside will apply when the viewport **is** 599 pixels **or narrower**. This approach is typically used for graceful degradation, starting with a design for larger screens and then adapting it for smaller screens.

  

In a scenario where `min-width` and `max-width` are set to the same value, it creates a media query that targets exactly one specific viewport width, which is generally not very practical in responsive design. For instance, `@media (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 600px) {...}` will only apply its styles when the viewport width is exactly 600 pixels.
