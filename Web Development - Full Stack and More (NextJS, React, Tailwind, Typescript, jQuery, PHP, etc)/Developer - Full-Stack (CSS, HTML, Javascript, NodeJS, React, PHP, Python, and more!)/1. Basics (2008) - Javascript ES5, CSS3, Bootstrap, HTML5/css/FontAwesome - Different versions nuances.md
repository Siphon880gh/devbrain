Note that in version 5 and later, the "regular" style is mostly part of the Pro (paid) plan, so the free version primarily includes the "solid" icons and brand icons.

For example:
- Font Awesome 4.x.x:
	- The class is used as fa fa-microphone.
	- Example: <i class="fa fa-microphone"></i>
- Font Awesome 5.x.x and later:
	- With the introduction of different styles, the class usage became more specific. For the free version, it's usually fas fa-microphone for solid, far fa-microphone for regular (if available), and fab for brands (not applicable for a microphone).
	- Example for solid: <i class="fas fa-microphone"></i>

SVG with JS vs Web Fonts: Font Awesome 5 and above introduced SVG with JavaScript, giving you scalable vector icons that can instantly be customized — size, color, drop shadow, etc. — via CSS. Older versions used font files, and the methods aren't directly compatible.

Stacking them could cause icons to become a rectangle
