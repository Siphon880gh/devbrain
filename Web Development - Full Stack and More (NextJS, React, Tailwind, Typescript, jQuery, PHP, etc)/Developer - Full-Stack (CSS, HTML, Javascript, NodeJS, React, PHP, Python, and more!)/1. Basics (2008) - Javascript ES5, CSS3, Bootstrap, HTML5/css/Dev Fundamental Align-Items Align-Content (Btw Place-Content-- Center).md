align-content and justify-content are the counter opposites with axes


align-items, eg in a flex column, is just concerning one line (in regards to centering, flex-start, etc)

btw in the future it’s just start and flex-start will become obsolete

  
align-content, eg. in a flex column, is concerned with the distribution of lines. The effects are only visually evident if you have multiple lines (so you’re going to need enough children to wrap over to the next line in a flex column - and the wrap property for flex must be on)
