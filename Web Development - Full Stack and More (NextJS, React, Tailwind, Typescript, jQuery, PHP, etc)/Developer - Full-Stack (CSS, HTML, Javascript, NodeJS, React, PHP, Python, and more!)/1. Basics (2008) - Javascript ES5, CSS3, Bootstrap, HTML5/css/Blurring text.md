I have in html, a div that overlays a part of the page. I make it gray background. How to have some of what's underneath show through but blurred?

To achieve an effect where a `div` overlays a part of a webpage with a gray background while allowing some of what's underneath to show through in a blurred manner, you can use a combination of CSS properties. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Set up your HTML structure:** You should have a `div` that overlays the content. This `div` will have the gray background and the blur effect applied to the content underneath it.

```html
<div class="content">
<!-- Your underlying content goes here -->
</div>
<div class="overlay"></div>
```

2. **Apply CSS for the overlay:** Use CSS to style the overlay `div`. You'll need to set the background color to gray and use the `backdrop-filter` property to apply the blur effect to the content behind the overlay.

```css
.overlay {
 position: absolute; /* or fixed, depending on your layout */
 top: 0;
 left: 0;
 right: 0;
 bottom: 0;
 background-color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.5); /* Gray color with transparency */
 backdrop-filter: blur(10px); /* Adjust the blur value as needed */
}
```

3. **Ensure the HTML structure and CSS work together:** The `overlay` `div` should be positioned over the content that you want to blur. This is typically done by positioning the overlay absolutely or fixed within a relatively positioned parent container.

4. **Browser Compatibility:** Be aware that the `backdrop-filter` property may not be supported in all browsers. Check its compatibility on [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/?search=backdrop-filter) and consider providing fallback styles for browsers that do not support it.

With these steps, the overlay `div` will have a semi-transparent gray background, and the content underneath it will appear blurred through the overlay. Adjust the `rgba` values and the `blur()` value to achieve the desired level of transparency and blur.
