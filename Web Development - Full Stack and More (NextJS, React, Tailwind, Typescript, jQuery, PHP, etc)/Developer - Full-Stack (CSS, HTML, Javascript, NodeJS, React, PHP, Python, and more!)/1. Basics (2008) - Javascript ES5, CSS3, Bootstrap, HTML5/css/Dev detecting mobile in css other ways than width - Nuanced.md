CSS media queries primarily rely on the dimensions and characteristics of the viewport, which means they are not explicitly designed to detect devices like phones in terms of their actual hardware. However, media queries can target certain features that are more common on mobile devices.

One approach that goes beyond just screen width is to use the `pointer` and `hover` features in media queries to target devices with touch screens, which are typically phones and tablets:

```css
/* Targets touch devices which often implies phones and tablets */
@media (hover: none) and (pointer: coarse) {
  /* CSS rules for touch-based devices */
}

/* Targets devices with fine pointers, usually indicative of a desktop environment */
@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
  /* CSS rules for devices with a mouse pointer */
}
```

The `(hover: none)` feature is indicative of devices that do not have the capability to hover, suggesting touch screens. The `(pointer: coarse)` feature indicates a touch interface rather than a precise pointer like a mouse.

Another feature that can be useful is `orientation`, which can be `portrait` or `landscape`:

```css
/* Targets devices with a portrait orientation, often phones */
@media (orientation: portrait) {
  /* CSS rules */
}
```

While `orientation` does not exclusively apply to mobile phones, it is common for phones to be used in portrait mode.

It's important to note that these features are not foolproof in detecting a phone, as there are many touch-enabled laptops and convertible devices, as well as tablets that can share similar traits. Moreover, as of my last update, there is no CSS media query that can definitively differentiate between a mobile phone and any other touch device solely based on software characteristics. For true device detection, you would typically need to use JavaScript or server-side user agent detection.
