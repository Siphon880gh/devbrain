In web design, the way a browser calculates an element's width is largely dependent on the type of element and the display property assigned to it. Here's a basic overview:

1. **Block-Level Elements**: These elements automatically fill the available horizontal space of their parent element. The width of block-level elements, by default, stretches to occupy the full width available in their containing element. Examples of block-level elements include `<div>`, `<p>`, and `<section>`.

2. **Inline Elements**: Unlike block-level elements, inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary to fit their content. Their width is determined by the content within them, and they do not fill the full width of their parent element. Examples of inline elements are `<span>`, `<a>`, and `<img>`.

3. **CSS Properties Influencing Width**: The actual width of an element can be further modified using CSS properties. For example, setting the `width` property explicitly defines the width of an element. The `padding`, `border`, and `margin` properties also affect the overall space an element occupies, but they do not change the content's width directly. 

4. **Box Model**: Understanding the CSS box model is crucial in web design. It considers the content's width, padding, border, and margin to determine the space an element occupies. For block-level elements, unless a width is specified, the content area stretches to the container's width, with padding, borders, and margins applied additionally.

5. **Display Property**: The `display` property in CSS can change how elements behave. For example, setting `display: inline-block;` on an element makes it flow like an inline element but respects width and height values like a block-level element.

6. **Viewport and Responsive Design**: The width of elements can also be responsive to the viewport size, meaning their width changes based on the screen size. This is often achieved using relative units like percentages or viewport units (vw, vh) and CSS media queries.

Understanding these concepts is essential for effectively controlling layout and styling in web design.
