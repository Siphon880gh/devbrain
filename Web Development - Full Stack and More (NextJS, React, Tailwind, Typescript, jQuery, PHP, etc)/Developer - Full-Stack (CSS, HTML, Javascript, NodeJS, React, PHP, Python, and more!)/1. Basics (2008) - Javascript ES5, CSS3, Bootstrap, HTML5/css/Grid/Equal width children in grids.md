Two columns of equal width using the Grid layout. Here's the HTML and CSS you'll need:

#### HTML:
```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
</div>
```


```css
.grid {
  display: grid;
  gap: 1rem; /* Adjust this value to match the desired gap size */
}

.grid-cols-2 {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
}

.gap-4 { 
	row-gap: 1rem; /* Vertical spacing */ 
	column-gap: 1rem; /* Horizontal spacing */
}
```

Explanation:

- **.grid**: This class defines the display mode of the container to be grid. The `gap` property is set to `1rem`, which determines the space between the columns (and rows, if any). The value `1rem` is just an example; you can adjust it to suit your design needs.

- **.grid-cols-2**: This class sets up the grid with two columns of equal width. The `grid-template-columns` property uses the `repeat()` function, which repeats a section of the track list. In this case, `repeat(2, 1fr)` creates two columns (`2`) that each take up one fraction of the available space (`1fr`), making them equal in width.

- **.gap-4**: This class ensures there is a consistent space of `1rem` between your grid items both vertically and horizontally
