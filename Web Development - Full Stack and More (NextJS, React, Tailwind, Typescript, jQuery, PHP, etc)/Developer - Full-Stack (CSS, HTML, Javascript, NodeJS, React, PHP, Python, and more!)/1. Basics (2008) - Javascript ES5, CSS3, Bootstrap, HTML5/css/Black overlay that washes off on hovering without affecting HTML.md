Usually you have a relative parent and an absolute child black overlay, but that's structuring your HTML for a visual effect.

Instead, your ::before can be the overlay!

Explain:


```
.grayish-image {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 0;
}

.grayish-image::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  background-color: black;
  opacity: 0.7;
  z-index: 1;
  pointer-events: none; /* so it doesn't interfere with interactions with the main element */
}

.grayish-image:hover::before {
  opacity: 0.3;
}
```

The CSS code provided applies styling to elements with the class `grayish-image` and makes use of the `::before` pseudo-element to produce a visual effect. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Targeting the main element**:
   ```css
   .grayish-image {
     position: relative;
     z-index: 0;
   }
   ```
   - `position: relative;`: This sets the position property of `.grayish-image` to `relative`, which means that any absolutely positioned child or pseudo-element will be positioned relative to it.
   - `z-index: 0;`: This sets the stacking order of the `.grayish-image` element. Elements with a higher z-index will be drawn above those with a lower z-index.

2. **Creating the overlay using the `::before` pseudo-element**:
   ```css
   .grayish-image::before {
     content: "";
     position: absolute;
     top: 0;
     right: 0;
     bottom: 0;
     left: 0;
     background-color: black;
     opacity: 0.7;
     z-index: 1;
     pointer-events: none;
   }
   ```
   - `content: "";`: This is necessary for the `::before` pseudo-element to be generated.
   - `position: absolute;`: This positions the pseudo-element in relation to its nearest positioned ancestor, which in this case is `.grayish-image`.
   - `top: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0;`: These values stretch the pseudo-element to cover the entire area of the `.grayish-image`.
   - `background-color: black;`: This sets the background color of the pseudo-element to black.
   - `opacity: 0.7;`: This makes the pseudo-element (black overlay) slightly transparent, so the element beneath it (`grayish-image`) is still somewhat visible.
   - `z-index: 1;`: This ensures that the pseudo-element is displayed above the main `.grayish-image` element.
   - `pointer-events: none;`: This is an important property here. It ensures that any mouse interactions (like clicks or hovers) will pass through the pseudo-element and target the actual `.grayish-image` element instead. Without this property, the pseudo-element would block interactions with the main element.

3. **Changing the overlay opacity on hover**:
   ```css
   .grayish-image:hover::before {
     opacity: 0.3;
   }
   ```
   - When you hover over an element with the class `.grayish-image`, the opacity of the `::before` pseudo-element (the black overlay) will change to `0.3`, making it even more transparent.

The end result of this code is that any element with the class `grayish-image` will appear to have a grayish overlay. This overlay will become lighter when you hover over the element, giving the appearance that the image itself is becoming brighter on hover.
