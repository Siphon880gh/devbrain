does css background-image need an alt tag

\>>
No, CSS background images do not need alt tags. Alt tags are used to describe the content of an image to screen readers and other assistive technologies. **Background images are not displayed in the same way as regular images, so they do not need alt tags. However, if the background image is important for the content of the page, it is a good idea to add a title tag to the element that contains the background image. This will allow screen readers to announce the title of the image, even if the image itself is not displayed.**  
Here are some additional tips for using CSS background images:  
* Use descriptive names for your background images. This will make it easier to identify the images when you need to change them later.  
* Use a consistent naming convention for your background images. This will make it easier to organize your images and find the ones you need.  
* Use a variety of background images to add interest to your pages. Don't just use the same image over and over again.  
* Use background images that are appropriate for the content of your pages. Don't use a background image that is too distracting or that doesn't fit the overall look and feel of your pages.
