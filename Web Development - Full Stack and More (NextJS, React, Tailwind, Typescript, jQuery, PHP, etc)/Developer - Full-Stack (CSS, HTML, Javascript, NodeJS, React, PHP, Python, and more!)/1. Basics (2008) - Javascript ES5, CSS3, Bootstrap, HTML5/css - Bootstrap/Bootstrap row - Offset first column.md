To start the first column in a row at an offset of 4 columns from the left in Bootstrap 5, you can use the `offset-*` classes along with `col-*` classes. Here's how you can achieve that:

  

```html

<div class="container">

  <div class="row">

    <div class="col-4 offset-4">

      <!-- Your content for the first column here -->

    </div>

    <div class="col">

      <!-- Your content for the remaining columns here -->

    </div>

  </div>

</div>

```

  

In this example, the `offset-4` class is applied to the first column, which means it will start 4 columns from the left. The `col` class is applied to the remaining column to ensure they occupy the available space evenly. You can adjust the offset value as needed to achieve your desired layout.
