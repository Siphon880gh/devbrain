The taskbar of bubbles in a navigation UI is typically called a **"pagination indicator"** or **"stepper"**. Specifically, for mobile apps, it's often referred to as:

1. **Pagination Dots** or **Pagination Bubbles**: This is used when navigating between pages or screens, and each dot/bubble represents a page. Users can tap on these bubbles to navigate to a specific page.
2. **Step Indicator** or **Stepper**: This is often used in workflows or forms where users need to complete steps in sequence. Each bubble or dot represents a step in the process, and clicking on the bubble takes you to that specific step.

In the context of navigation in a React Native app, it's just a **custom tab bar** or **custom tab navigation**, with bubbles or icons representing each tab/page.

If you’re referring specifically to a horizontal bar with clickable bubbles indicating which page you are on, you could also call it a **horizontal pagination bar** or **navigation bar with step bubbles** depending on your specific use case.
