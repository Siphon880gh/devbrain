If there's no formal brand design in place yet, that doesn’t mean the website has to look generic. Typography alone can go a long way in making a page feel polished, intentional, and distinct.

This guide is for anyone who wants their page to look more designed than default. Even without a complete brand system, thoughtful use of type—spacing, sizing, and subtle effects—can dramatically improve visual quality. The goal isn’t to make the site look flashy or overly stylized, but simply to lift it above the basic, template-like feel that many default settings create.

Once you do establish a brand design—whether it’s minimal and modern, editorial and expressive, or bold and tech-forward—you’ll likely revisit and refine these typographic styles. At that point, typography becomes a key tool for expressing brand identity through tone, rhythm, and detail. But until then, these adjustments will make your page feel intentional, clear, and more professional.

This effect can be achieved with careful adjustments:
- **Letter-spacing** gives text more room to breathe, often contributing to a modern or high-end aesthetic.
- **Text-shadow** adds soft dimensionality—just enough to evoke depth without distraction.
- **Line-height** ensures readability while establishing visual rhythm and balance.

### **Subheading** Example Guidelines

Eg. h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6
```css
font-size: 1.5rem;
letter-spacing: 0.08em; /* Equivalent to ~2pt */
text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);
```

This combination creates a subheading that feels engraved or pressed into the page—similar to a title on a printed book. It stands out subtly, using shadow and spacing rather than weight or color.

### **Body Text** Example Guidelines

```css
font-size: 1rem;
letter-spacing: 1pt | 2pt | 3pt /* Or 0.05em ~ 1.5pt */
line-height: 1.5rem;
```

For body copy, spacing remains important. A slightly increased letter-spacing adds a refined, breathable feel. The line-height ensures clear vertical spacing that aids legibility without compressing the content.

### Font Pairings to Match a Refined Brand Tone

The right typeface pairing reinforces the non-default, premium aesthetic. Below are a few combinations that support this tone, along with their characteristics:

|Font Pairing|Why It Works|
|---|---|
|**Playfair Display + Inter**|Classic meets modern. Playfair offers contrast and elegance; Inter provides clean readability.|
|**DM Serif Display + Lato**|Friendly yet upscale. DM Serif’s curves pair well with Lato’s approachable sans-serif structure.|
|**Cinzel + Open Sans**|Cinzel evokes Roman inscription styles, offering a distinct, engraved feel; Open Sans keeps the tone grounded.|
|**Source Serif Pro + Source Sans Pro**|A clean, professional pairing. Balanced weight and spacing across both fonts.|
|**Cormorant Garamond + Noto Sans**|Refined and literary. Cormorant offers a boutique or editorial feel, while Noto Sans ensures readability across platforms.|
