In JavaScript, the term "interpolation" in the context of template literals refers to the process of embedding expressions within a string. This term is borrowed from mathematics, where interpolation is the method of finding new data points within the range of a known data set.

Not to be confused with animation's "Linear interpolation", or “lerp” for short, is a technique commonly used when programming things like games or GUIs. In principle, a lerp function “eases” the transition between two values over time, using some simple math.
