Mac has a serious limitation where if you press both LMB and RMB, it cannot detect that both are being pressed. The reason why is that Apple never cared to adapt their mouse events to the mouse. The Mac trackpad is either one click for LMB or two finger click for RMB.

This lack of detection is not just at the OS level but extends into the web browsers of course.

Reminder:
- LMB = Left mouse button
- RMB = Right mouse button
