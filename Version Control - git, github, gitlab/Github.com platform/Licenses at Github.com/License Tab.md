Create a License tab at your Github repo page?

Looks like this:

Clicking the tab shows:

All you need is a "LICENSE" file at the app root.

It's just a raw text file but without the .txt file extension. Get the raw text from:
![[Pasted image 20250526070127.png]]

The url to Apache v2.0 is at: [https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/)  

To choose a different license (Like Apache):
[https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

Make sure you fill in any year or name placeholders in the license or someone clicking the tab to read it will see the funny placeholders. MIT's has placeholders:
