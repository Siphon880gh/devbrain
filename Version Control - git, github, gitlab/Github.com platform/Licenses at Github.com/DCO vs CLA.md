## **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) vs. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**

While some projects require a **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)** (a formal legal document signed once per contributor), the **DCO is much simpler** and is accepted per commit instead.

Many open-source projects (such as Linux, Docker, and Kubernetes) prefer the **DCO** over **CLAs** because it’s easier for contributors.

They usually **require** every commit message to contain a "Signed-off-by" line, which serves as a **self-certification** of compliance with the DCO. You add the **"Signed-off-by"** line to your commit message. You can use Git hook per repo to automatically add the signed off by line. 

You can see reps that allow contributions under DCO, such as **Linux Kernel**, require **every commit** to have this line.
```
`Signed-off-by: Siphon880gh <weng.f.fung@gmail.com>`
```

## **When Should You Use the DCO?**

- If you're working on **open-source projects** where legal contribution rights are important.
- If you contribute to projects that enforce the **DCO requirement** (like the Linux Kernel).
- If you want an **easy alternative** to Contributor License Agreements (CLAs).

## **Automating DCO Enforcement**

If you manage a project and want to enforce the DCO:

1. **Use Git Hooks**
    - The hook you shared ensures a "Signed-off-by" line is added and prevents duplicates.
    - This can be placed in `.git/hooks/commit-msg`:
	```
	#!/bin/sh
	SOB=$(git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT | sed -n 's/^\(.*>\).*$/Signed-off-by: \1/p')
	grep -qs "^$SOB" "$1" || echo "$SOB" >> "$1"
	
	test "" = "$(grep '^Signed-off-by: ' "$1" |
	   sort | uniq -c | sed -e '/^[ 	]*1[ 	]/d')" || {
	   echo >&2 "Duplicate Signed-off-by lines detected."
	   exit 1
	}
	```        
1. **Use a GitHub Bot**
    - The **DCO GitHub app** can automatically check for compliance.
    - You can enable **DCO checks** in repositories hosted on GitHub.
