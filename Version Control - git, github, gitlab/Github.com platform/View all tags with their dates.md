**Step 1:**
At repo page, look for Releases section. If there is, then you can view the tags. 

At the Releases section, there is either a "+ X releases" or not depending on how many tags there are. Your instructions are different depending if that line exists.

**If...**
If "+ X releases" exists, click it to see a list of tags and dates.
