If a startup puts their code on GitHub under the MIT license, that’s the real deal. It’s actually open source. You can use it, modify it, even sell it — no strings attached, no need to pay or ask permission.

They’re giving up control to build real trust and adoption. It signals confidence, openness, and a desire to let the community do what they want with the code. That kind of license builds goodwill _and_ lets devs use it freely in production without legal headaches.
