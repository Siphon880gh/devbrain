Then you can either choose to Merge the pull request, OR to cancel the pull request
- Merging: Note that if you have more restrictive settings on the Github repo, it may require that only a different contributing user than the pull request user can merge. You click the green "Merge pull request" button. It will appear as:

- Cancelling: Press gray "Close pull request" button. Cancelling will appear as closed:
