Pull requests tab shows `is:pr` for filter:

This is just for completion sake. If you removed `is:issue` or `is:pr` (stands for pull requests), the list of issues or pull requests don't change. 

GitHub uses a shared interface for both **Issues** and **Pull Requests**, because they’re both based on the same underlying data model (they’re both "issues" under the hood) and when creating issue or pull requests, you can title it and add description. Both similar interface:

However, you can't change `is:pr` to `is:issue` or vice versa so that issues appear under pull requests tab or so that pull requests appears under issues tab. 

This is just a quirk.
