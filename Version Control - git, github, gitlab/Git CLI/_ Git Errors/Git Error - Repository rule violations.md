Rawly:
```
To github.com:Siphon880gh/devbrain.git

Â ! [remote rejected] main -> main (push declined due to repository rule violations)

error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:Siphon880gh/devbrain.git'
```

This is because you've accidentally exposed an API key. Git prevents you from pushing online if an API key is exposed.

What if you really want to push the API key and make it publicly available?

Theoretically, you could force the API key up to the repo:
```sh
git push --no-verify -f
```

But **if your company has DLP (Data Loss Prevention) or GitHub Security Policies**, this might not work.

Keep in mind that attackers scrape GitHub for leaked keys **within seconds**! ðŸš¨
