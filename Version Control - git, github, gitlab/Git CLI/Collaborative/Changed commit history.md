**Inform Team Members:** If you're working in a team, inform everyone that they will need to fetch the latest history and reset their local copies since the history has changed. They can do this by using:


`git fetch origin git reset --hard origin/<branch-name>`

They should do this for each branch they are working on, replacing `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch they need to update.
