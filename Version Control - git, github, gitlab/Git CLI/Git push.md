Git push

```
git push origin __remoteBranch__

```

When you use git push origin remoteBranch, you're telling Git to push your changes to a branch named remoteBranch on the remote repository named origin. Here are the key points:
Remote Branch Existence: The branch remoteBranch doesn't need to exist in your local repository for you to push to it. If it doesn't exist on the remote, this command will create it.
Local Tracking Not Required: You don't need to have a local branch tracking remoteBranch to push to it. You could be pushing changes from any branch in your local repository to remoteBranch on the remote.
Permissions: Your ability to push to remoteBranch depends on whether you have the necessary permissions to do so in the remote repository.

Use Case: This command is useful in scenarios where you might want to push changes from a local branch to a different branch on the remote or create a new branch on the remote with your current local commits.
