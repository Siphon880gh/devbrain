Tracking allows you to run commands like git push  and git pull  without specifying the remote branch name. As for the default remote, itâ€™s usually origin - refer to [[Default Remote]] on how to manage this.

git pull  vs git pull origin remoteBranch 
If the current local branch has a tracking relationship set up with a remote branch, simply using git pull without specifying the remote and branch will fetch and merge changes from the tracked remote branch.

To see tracking or lack of tracking for all you branches, run:
git branch --vv

This is example output:
$ git branch -vv
```
* feature-x     a1b2c3d [origin/feature-x: ahead 2] Add new feature X
  main         e3d4c5b [origin/main] Update README.md
  experiment   f4e5d6c Not tracking any remote branch
```


In this example:
feature-x: This branch is currently checked out (denoted by the *). It's tracking origin/feature-x and is 2 commits ahead of the remote branch.
main: This branch is tracking origin/main. There's no ahead/behind information, which usually means the local branch is in sync with the remote branch.
experiment: This branch is not tracking any remote branch, as indicated by the "Not tracking any remote branch" message.

At at current local branch, you can set the tracking to a remote branch:
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/remoteBranchName


Yes, when you push a local branch to a remote repository for the first time using git push -u or git push --set-upstream, Git sets up the tracking relationship between your local branch and the remote branch automatically. This means that subsequent git fetch, git pull, and git push operations for that branch will default to using the established remote branch. If you use git push origin localBranchName without the -u or --set-upstream option, Git will push the localBranchName to the origin remote, but it won't automatically set up the tracking relationship between the local branch and the remote branch. If you wanted to set tracking information, later you would run:
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/localBranchName localBranchName


git push origin  vs git pull origin remoteBranch 
The difference between git push origin __remoteBranch__ and git push origin lies in the specificity of which branch is being pushed to the remote repository:
git push origin __remoteBranch__: This command explicitly specifies which branch you want to push to the remote repository. Replace __remoteBranch__ with the name of the branch you want to push. This command is useful when you want to be explicit about the branch you are pushing, especially if it's different from your current branch or if you are creating a new branch on the remote. For example, if you're on a branch named feature and want to push it to a branch named new-feature on the remote, you would use git push origin feature:new-feature. If the __remoteBranch__ does not exist on the remote, Git will create this new branch on the remote repository with the history of the branch you are pushing.
git push origin: When you omit the branch name, Git uses the current branch's tracking information to determine where to push the changes. If the current branch is set to track a branch from the origin remote (which is often set up automatically when you clone or when you set up a new branch with -u), then git push origin will push the current branch to its tracked branch on the remote. If the current branch has no upstream tracking information set, Git will return an error unless you have the push.default configuration set to a value like current or matching.

In summary, specifying the branch provides clarity and control over which branch is being pushed, while omitting the branch relies on the current branch's tracking configuration to determine where to push.


Push default vs matching

The `push.default` configuration in Git determines how Git behaves when the `git push` command is executed without specifying a branch. There are several settings for `push.default`, but you asked about two: `current` and `matching`. Let's delve into what these two settings mean:

1. **`current`**: When `push.default` is set to `current`, executing `git push` without specifying a branch will push the current branch to a remote branch with the same name. If the remote branch does not exist, it will be created. This setting is useful if you want to ensure that you're only pushing changes from the branch you're currently working on, and you want to avoid accidentally pushing changes from other branches.

2. **`matching`**: When `push.default` is set to `matching`, executing `git push` without specifying a branch will push all your local branches to the remote branches with the same names. This means if you have local branches A, B, and C, and the remote has branches A and B, `git push` will push changes from your local A and B to the remote A and B. It will not push branch C since there's no matching branch on the remote. This setting is broader and can lead to pushing to multiple branches at once, which might not be desirable in all situations.

To find out which `push.default` setting is currently configured in your Git environment, you can use the following command:

```bash
git config --global push.default
```

This command will output the current setting. If it doesn't output anything, it means that the default value, which is `matching` in Git versions earlier than 2.0 and `simple` in Git versions 2.0 and above, is being used. The `simple` setting is like `current`, but it also requires the upstream branch to have the same name as the local branch.

To explicitly check for both local and global configurations (since Git configurations can be set at both levels), you can use these commands:

- For global configuration: `git config --global push.default`
- For local repository configuration: `git config --local push.default`

These commands will help you identify the `push.default` setting in your environment, ensuring you understand how `git push` will behave in your workflow.


Push Default vs Matching - Setting

To set the `push.default` configuration in Git, you can use the `git config` command. You can set this configuration at two levels: globally, which applies the setting to all of your repositories, or locally, which applies the setting only to the current repository. Here's how you can set it:

1. **Setting `push.default` Globally**: To set `push.default` globally, use the following command, replacing `setting` with your preferred option (like `current` or `matching`):

   ```bash
   git config --global push.default setting
   ```

   For example, to set it to `current` globally, you would use:

   ```bash
   git config --global push.default current
   ```

2. **Setting `push.default` Locally**: To set `push.default` for a specific repository, navigate to the repository's directory in your terminal or command prompt and then use the following command:

   ```bash
   git config --local push.default setting
   ```

   For instance, to set the local repository to use `matching`, you would execute:

   ```bash
   git config --local push.default matching
   ```

Remember, if a local configuration exists, it will override the global configuration for the specific repository. Setting this configuration helps to control the behavior of `git push`, ensuring it aligns with your workflow and reducing the likelihood of unintended pushes. Always choose the setting that best fits your workflow and the practices of your team or project.
