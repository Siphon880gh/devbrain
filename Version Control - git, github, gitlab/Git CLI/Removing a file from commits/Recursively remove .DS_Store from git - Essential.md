To remove the `.DS_Store` files from the Git cache, you can use the `git rm --cached` command. Here's the process:
 

1. Open the terminal or command prompt. 

2. Navigate to your Git repository's root directory using the `cd` command. For example:
  

   ```shell
   cd /path/to/repository
   ```

  
3. Run the following command to remove the `.DS_Store` files from the Git cache or staging areas and all future commits (as long as you don't re-add):
  

  ```shell
   git rm --cached "**/.DS_Store"
   ```

  
   This command will remove all `.DS_Store` files from the Git cache recursively within the repository.
 

4. After running the command, you can check the status of the repository using `git status`:


   ```shell
   git status
   ```
 

   The output will show that the `.DS_Store` files are deleted from the cache and are ready to be committed.

  5. Finally, commit the changes to make them permanent using `git commit`:
 

  ```shell
   git commit -m "Remove .DS_Store files from Git cache"
   ```

  
   This will create a new commit that removes the `.DS_Store` files from the cache.
 

Now the `.DS_Store` files are removed from the Git cache, and they will no longer be tracked by Git. However, note that this process does not delete the `.DS_Store` files from your file system. If you want to remove them from your file system as well, you can use the appropriate file system commands, such as `find` and `rm`, as mentioned in the previous response.
