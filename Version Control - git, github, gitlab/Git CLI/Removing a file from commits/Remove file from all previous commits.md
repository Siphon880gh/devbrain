Remember, `.gitignore` only ignores untracked files/folders. If the folder has been previously committed, you need to remove it using something like:
```
git rm -r --cached "**/Private/**"
```

---

To remove all subfolders from Private:
`git rm -r --cached "**/Private/**"`

To remove all folders named "Private - Joe", "Private - John"
```
git rm -r --cached "**/Private/**"
```

---


- If you just want to remove a file from being tracked in future commits but don't care about its history, `git rm --cached` is sufficient (clearing the cache aka staging area).


For example:
```
git rm --cached "**/.DS_Store"
```

    
- If you want to purge a file completely from the entire history of the repository, then you'll need to use tools like `git filter-repo` or `git filter-branch`.


For example:
```
git filter-repo --path quizer-temporal-fx-381723.json --invert-paths
```


Remember, rewriting history (as with `filter-repo` or `filter-branch`) can be problematic in shared repositories since other collaborators will have a history that conflicts with the rewritten one. Always communicate and coordinate with collaborators when taking such actions.

<<
My git push was rejected because of "large files detected" from node_modules. I've already done 'git rm --cached "**/node_modules' and made a new git commit

\>>
If your `git push` was rejected due to large files in the `node_modules` directory even after you've removed it with `git rm --cached`, it's likely that the removal of `node_modules` hasn't been reflected in the remote repository's history. This can happen if the large files in `node_modules` were part of previous commits.

Here's how to address the problem:

1. **.gitignore:** First, make sure that you've added `node_modules` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being tracked by Git.

   Add this line to your `.gitignore`:

   ```
   node_modules/
   ```

2. **Rewrite History:** If the large files were already committed to the Git history, you need to rewrite the history to remove them. You can use the `git filter-branch` command or the BFG Repo-Cleaner, which is a simpler and faster alternative.

   With `git filter-branch` (not recommended for large repositories as it's slower):

   ```
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
   "git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch node_modules" \
   --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```

   With BFG Repo-Cleaner (recommended for larger repositories):

   ```
   bfg --delete-folders node_modules --no-blob-protection
   ```



   **Note:** This will update your repository's history, which can be destructive, especially if you're collaborating with others. Ensure you coordinate with other team members before doing this, as they will need to rebase their work on top of the updated history.

3. **Push Changes:** After rewriting the history, you'll need to force push your changes to the remote repository. **Be very careful with this step, as it will overwrite the history on the remote repository.**

   ```
   git push origin --force --all
   ```

4. **Inform Team Members:** If you're working in a team, inform everyone that they will need to fetch the latest history and reset their local copies since the history has changed. They can do this by using:

   ```
   git fetch origin
   git reset --hard origin/<branch-name>
   ```

   They should do this for each branch they are working on, replacing `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch they need to update.

Remember that rewriting history is potentially disruptive, especially for collaborative projects. It's best practice to avoid committing large files and directories to Git in the first place, and the `.gitignore` file is crucial for this. Always ensure that such sensitive operations are discussed and agreed upon if you're working in a team environment.

Does this take care of node_modules that are in subfolders?

\>>
Yes, both the `git filter-branch` and the BFG Repo-Cleaner approaches can take care of `node_modules` directories that are located in subfolders. The commands I provided are designed to affect the entire repository, which includes all instances of the `node_modules` directory, wherever they might be in the project structure.

For the `git filter-branch` command, the `--` at the end signifies that all references, including branches and tags, should be included in the rewrite. The `**/node_modules` pattern used with `git rm --cached` in your initial attempt should match `node_modules` directories at any level within your repository, but here's a more explicit command using `filter-branch` that ensures all `node_modules` folders are targeted, regardless of their location:

```bash
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
'git rm --cached -r -q --ignore-unmatch */node_modules' \
--prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

And if you're using the BFG Repo-Cleaner, it's designed to scan your entire repository for whatever you specify (such as folders named `node_modules`) and remove them from the entire history, except for the current commit if you use `--no-blob-protection`.

Make sure that after you have rewritten the history, you commit any changes to the `.gitignore` file to ensure that `node_modules` directories are ignored in future commits. 

Remember, as with any history rewriting, if the repository is shared with others, this will cause a disruption, and everyone will need to align their local history with the new remote history, typically with a hard reset, as previously described, or by re-cloning the repository.
