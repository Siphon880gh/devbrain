The command:
`git rm --cached -r library1/*`

**only affects the staging area of your current working commit** â€” it tells Git to stop tracking the files in `library1/` **starting now**, without deleting them from your working directory.

If you leave out `--cached`, the files will be gone from the repo and also physically deleted from your disk in your next commit.
