## Git rm cached limitations

When you run `git rm -r --cached "users/"`, it removes the files from the current working tree and the index, but the files still exist in your repository's history. This means the files and their history will still be present in older commits. If you want to completely remove the files from your repository's history, you would need to use a tool like `git filter-branch` or the BFG Repo-Cleaner. These tools can permanently remove files or data from your Git repository history. However, be cautious when altering history, as it can have unintended consequences, especially if the repository is shared with others.


To remove a file or directory from your entire Git history using `git filter-branch`, you would use the `--index-filter` option with a command that tells Git to remove the specified files or directories. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Backup Your Repository:** Before you start, it's crucial to backup your repository. The `git filter-branch` command irreversibly changes your history.

    ```bash
    git clone --mirror yourrepo.git yourrepo-backup.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to Your Repository:**

    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/repo
    ```

3. **Run git filter-branch:**
   To remove a directory or file from all commits, use the following command:

    ```bash
    git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
      'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch -r users/' \
      --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
    ```

    - `--force`: Forces the filter branch to run, even when there are warnings.
    - `--index-filter`: Allows you to specify a command that will edit the index before each commit is processed.
    - `'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch -r users/'`: This command removes the specified directory or file.
    - `--prune-empty`: Removes commits that become empty after removing the files.
    - `--tag-name-filter cat`: Adjusts tags to point to the rewritten commits.
    - `-- --all`: Specifies that all branches and tags should be rewritten.

4. **Check the Repository:**
   After running the command, thoroughly check your repository to ensure that the desired changes have been made and that nothing important has been lost.

5. **Push the Changes:**
   If you're satisfied with the changes and you've confirmed everything is working as expected:

    - First, force-push the changes to the remote repository:

        ```bash
        git push origin --force --all
        ```

    - If you have tags, you may also need to force-push them:

        ```bash
        git push origin --force --tags
        ```

6. **Inform Your Team:**
   If you're working with a team, inform everyone that they should re-clone the repository, as history has changed significantly.

7. **Cleanup and Recover:**
   If, for any reason, you need to restore the original state, you can use the backup you made at the beginning:

    ```bash
    git push -f origin 'refs/original/refs/heads/*:refs/heads/*'
    ```

**Warning:** `git filter-branch` rewrites the history of your repository, which can cause significant issues for anyone else who has a clone of the repository. They will have to re-clone the repository and may lose their local changes. This action is considered destructive and should be used with caution.
