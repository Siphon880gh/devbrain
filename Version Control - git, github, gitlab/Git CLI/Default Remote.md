The default remote in Git is often set automatically when you clone a repository, with the remote being named "origin.

Variations:
-git fetch origin: By specifying the remote, you're telling Git to fetch changes specifically from "origin," regardless of the current branch's default remote. Usually git fetch  is enough if you intend to download from git

Changing default remote and default remote branch
git branch --set-upstream-to=__remote__/__branch__ branchName
Replace remote with the name of the remote you want to set as default, branch with the name of the remote branch you want to track, and branchName with the name of your local branch.

For example, if you want to set the default remote to "origin" for a branch named "feature" that should track "origin/feature", you would use:
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/feature feature

This is in contrast to changing the origin url (like in the case you renamed your git repository or import/moved it)
git remote set-url origin __new-url__
