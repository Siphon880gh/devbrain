If running git log or committing gives this error:


```
fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at '/Users/ME/dev/web/app1/task1'
To add an exception for this directory, call:

        git config --global --add safe.directory  /Users/ME/dev/web/app1/task1
```

Or if VS Code shows:
```
The git repositories in the current folder are potentially unsafe as the folders are owned by someone other than the current user.
```

The error message you're encountering is due to a safety feature in Git that helps prevent unauthorized access to your repositories. This feature was introduced in more recent versions of Git to address security concerns, specifically related to the ownership of the repository directories.

When you see this message, it means that Git has detected that the ownership or permissions of the repository directory (or possibly its parent directories) are considered insecure or "dubious". This can happen for various reasons, such as when a repository is created by a different user than the one trying to access it, or when permissions are too open.

Here are a couple of ways you can resolve this issue:

1. **Add Safe Directory Configuration**  
   You can configure Git to trust the repository by adding it to the `safe.directory` configuration. This is precisely what the error message suggests. This can be done either globally or locally:
   
   - **Globally:** Applies the setting for all your repositories, for the current user.
```
git config --global --add safe.directory /Users/wengffung/dev/web/app1/task1
```
   
   - **Locally:** Applies the setting only to the specific repository.
```
cd /Users/wengffung/dev/web/app1/task1
git config --add safe.directory $(pwd)
```

2. **Check and Fix Ownership**  
   Sometimes, it's better to check why the ownership is considered dubious. This could involve looking at who owns the directory and what the permissions are. You can change the ownership to the current user if it's set incorrectly:
   
   ```bash
   sudo chown -R $(whoami) /Users/wengffung/dev/web/app1/task1
   sudo chmod -R u=rwx,g=rw,o= /Users/wengffung/dev/web/app1/task1
   ```
   This command changes the ownership to the current user and sets permissions appropriately. Make sure to adjust the permissions according to your security needs.

3. **Review Parent Directory Permissions**  
   Sometimes the issue is not with the repository itself but with one of the parent directories. Make sure that the permissions and ownership up the directory tree are secure and reasonable.

Choosing whether to add the directory to `safe.directory` or adjust ownership depends on your specific situation. If you're confident about the security of the directory and its contents, adding it to `safe.directory` is quick and effective. However, if you're unsure why the ownership is flagged as dubious, investigating and correcting any ownership issues might be a safer long-term solution.
