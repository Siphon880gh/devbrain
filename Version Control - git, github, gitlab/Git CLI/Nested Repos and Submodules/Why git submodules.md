### TLDR:
Git submodules are separate Git repositories that can be nested inside your main repository without interfering with its version control. They’re a practical way to include entire folders from other GitHub or GitLab repositories directly into your project. Each submodule, if they're also remote repositories, maintains its own origin independent of the parent repo.

To add a submodule, navigate to your repository and use the git submodule add command. This links the nested folder as a tracked submodule in your project—but managed separately from your main repo's history. While you can use the same external repository as a submodule across multiple projects, each project will have its own copy, so this approach doesn’t reduce storage space.

Adding submodules for nested repository folders in a Git project offers several advantages, particularly when managing complex projects with dependencies on specific versions of other projects or libraries. Here are some key benefits of using submodules:

### 1. **Version Control of Dependencies**

Submodules allow you to track specific commits of external repositories within your main project. This is particularly useful for ensuring that everyone working on the project is using the same version of each dependency, which can help prevent issues that arise from version discrepancies.

### 2. **Organizational Clarity**

Using submodules helps to clearly delineate the boundaries between your main project and external dependencies or related projects. This organization makes it easier to understand the project structure at a glance, including where code from other repositories is being used.

### 3. **Independent Development**

Submodules are separate repositories, so they can be developed independently of your main project. Changes can be made in a submodule without affecting the main repository until you decide to update the submodule reference. This is ideal for working on libraries that are used by multiple projects or by multiple teams.

### 4. **Selective Cloning**

When cloning a repository with submodules, you have the option to clone only the main repository or to also recursively clone all the submodules. This flexibility can be beneficial in scenarios where not all developers need access to the full codebase, or when you want to reduce the initial download size of the repository.

### 5. **Reusability**

Submodules can be used by multiple projects. By keeping common libraries or components as separate submodules, they can be reused across several projects without duplication. Any improvements or bug fixes made in the submodule are easily propagated to all projects that use it.

### 6. **Controlled Updates**

Because submodules are linked to specific commits, updates to submodules are deliberate and controlled. You decide when to update to a newer commit of a submodule, which helps in managing dependencies proactively and avoiding unexpected breaks due to external changes.

### 7. **Isolation of Changes**

Changes in a submodule are isolated from the main repository until explicitly updated. This means that the main project can continue functioning with a stable version of a submodule even as new development continues within that submodule.

### Drawbacks to Consider

Despite these advantages, there are also some drawbacks to using submodules:

- **Complexity**: Managing submodules adds complexity to repository management, especially in terms of keeping track of submodule states and ensuring that all developers have correctly initialized and updated their submodules.
- **Additional Commands Required**: Developers need to learn additional Git commands and workflows specific to submodule management, such as initializing, updating, and pushing changes to submodules.
- **Potential for Errors**: If not managed carefully, it's easy to end up in a state where the submodule is pointing to an incorrect commit, or submodules are not properly initialized after cloning, leading to build failures or missing dependencies.

Overall, submodules can be a powerful tool for managing complex projects with external dependencies, provided that the team is comfortable with the additional complexity and workflow requirements.
