You can remove all the images created on your system by Docker to save space. This is a good point in the challenge series to do so because the next challenge starts new files entirely.

Run `docker images` to see the images we've created performing the previous challenges.

Then this is the command to delete:
```
docker rmi NAME:TAG --force
```
