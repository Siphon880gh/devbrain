We will work based off [[1.1 Consistent Python Interpreter]] files

Let's work locally first. In that challenge, we proved the same python version when using Docker to run the script on local development vs a remote development. Now we prove, while practicing, that python packages are the same versions in different environments (local vs remote).

Create requirements.txt:
```
flask==2.3.3
```

Modify Dockerfile to:
```
# Use the specific NodeJS base image (bundled in Debian)
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container.
# All below commands will work from working directory.
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements.txt file to the container
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install the Python packages
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy your application files (if any)
COPY . .

# Specify the command to run your application (optional, depends on your use case)
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

^ We've added a pip install against the requirements.txt. Although `COPY . .` is sufficient if we had moved that line to above the `RUN pip install..` command, having `COPY requirements.txt` is just more explicit and communicates the intention to other developers.

Modify app.py to:
```
import sys
import flask

print(f"Hello, my Python version is expected to be around 3.9, and it actually is: {sys.version}") # Prints python version
print(f"And my Flask version is expected to be around 2.3.3, and it actually is: {flask.__version__}") # Prints Flask version
```

Build the Docker Image by running the following command in the directory where your `Dockerfile` is located:
```
docker build -t consistent_python:v1.1 .
```

> [!note] Efficient version bumping
> When you ran the bumped up version for the tag v1.0 → v1.1, that `docker build -t test:v1.1 .` has Docker build an image reeusing any cached layers from the previous build (v1.0) **if** nothing has changed in the relevant steps of the `Dockerfile`. Therefore, this step does not have to re-download the python-debian base image. It downloads the new flask package though.


Once the image is built, you can create and run a container from it:
```
docker run -it consistent_python:v1.1
```

Your output could be:
```
Hello, my Python version is expected to be around 3.9, and it actually is: 3.9.21 (main, Feb 25 2025, 10:00:15) [GCC 12.2.0]

And my Flask version is expected to be around 2.3.3, and it actually is: 2.3.3
```

Test on remote server:
Copy your folder of files (with the app.py, requirements.txt, Dockerfile, .dockerignore) into a remote server. Then SSH and repeat the steps to check it's the same output when you build then run the image.
