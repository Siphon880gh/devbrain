This challenge can be skipped if you don't plan to share CLI shells with other developers.

An use case is improving ffmpeg as an open source CLI tool to convert videos, then you can share the terminal with other developers to use ffmpeg in their terminal

We will not actually improve the ffmpeg code in this challenge. In lieu of that, we will actually bundle in a command line tool of our own coding in lieu of ffmpeg.

Create Dockerfile:
```
# Use Debian as the base image
FROM debian:bullseye-slim

# Set the working directory in the container.
# All below commands will work from working directory.
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the test1 script and make it executable
COPY test1 /usr/local/bin/
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/test1

# Ensure we're using bash as the shell
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]

# Set the default command to start a shell
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```
^ Notice that a Bash terminal is opened
^ Notice that executable permission is granted to the script
^ Note the /usr/local/bin/ path is already included in the default $PATH in Debian Bullseye-Slim. So when running commands, it looks in many paths including that one, for executables named the same as the command. No extra work done needed.

Create test1: (no file extension)
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Success" 
```
^ Notice the shebang at the first line ensures the script is executed using the Bash shell


Let's make the test script executable on your host machine so Docker can preserve the permissions:
```
chmod +x test1
```

Build the image:
```
docker build -t exec-shell .
```

Run the virtual container off of the image:
```
docker run -it exec-shell
```

You are now inside a shell with immediate access to the test1 command:
![[Pasted image 20250303024753.png]]

Running the command `test1` works as expected, printing the word "Success".

Alternately, you can pass the `test1` command to the `docker run` command and it'll close the terminal right away:
`docker run -it exec-shell test1`:
![[Pasted image 20250303024930.png]]

>[!note] Why not command `test`
>We chose `test1` because `test` is a command that's available on many Linux distros including Debian Bullseye. You would have to type the entire path instead of the executable name to run it like `/usr/local/bin/test` because the default `test` cli tool would take over.
