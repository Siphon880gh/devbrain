- **x86**: This refers to the 32-bit architecture based on the original Intel 8086 CPU and its successors. It's indeed commonly associated with older computers, as it has been largely superseded by 64-bit architectures in modern personal computers and servers.
    
- **x86_64**: Also known as x64, AMD64, or Intel 64, this is the 64-bit extension of the x86 architecture. It supports much larger amounts of virtual and physical memory than 32-bit systems, and it's the architecture found in most modern desktop and server CPUs manufactured by both Intel and AMD.
    
- **Usage in Intel and AMD processors**: Both Intel and AMD use the x86_64 architecture in their modern desktop and server processors. This architecture allows these processors to be backward compatible with older software designed for the x86 (32-bit) architecture while also supporting newer 64-bit software.
