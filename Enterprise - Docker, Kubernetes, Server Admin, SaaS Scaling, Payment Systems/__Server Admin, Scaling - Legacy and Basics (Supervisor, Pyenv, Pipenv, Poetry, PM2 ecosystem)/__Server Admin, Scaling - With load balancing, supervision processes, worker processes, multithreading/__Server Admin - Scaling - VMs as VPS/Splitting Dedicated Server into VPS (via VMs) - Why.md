Not only for scalability reasons
- You can control how much CPU resources, etc are used per VPS)
- You can upgrade your physical dedicated server, then add more VMs

But for server management reasons too
- If rented colocation, you rely on their support team to restart/reinstall, which could take hours
- By isolating your public facing server into a VPS, your dedicated server is never touched. If a VPS is bad, you can restore/reinstall the VPS from your dedicated server.
