The Cockpit Project itself is a web-based graphical interface for managing Linux servers, providing a user-friendly way to manage system tasks. Cockpit doesn't directly perform virtualization; instead, it provides tools to manage and interact with existing virtualization technologies.

Cockpit integrates with several virtualization tools and technologies:

1. **Libvirt**: Cockpit can manage virtual machines through libvirt, which is a toolkit to manage virtualization platforms like KVM, QEMU, and others. Libvirt can perform both hardware virtualization (using hypervisors like KVM) and paravirtualization.

2. **Docker and Podman**: Cockpit includes support for managing containers, which is a form of OS-level virtualization rather than traditional hardware virtualization.

In summary, Cockpit itself is not a hypervisor and does not perform hardware virtualization directly. It provides a management interface for tools that do, like KVM (which uses hardware virtualization) and container management tools like Docker and Podman.
