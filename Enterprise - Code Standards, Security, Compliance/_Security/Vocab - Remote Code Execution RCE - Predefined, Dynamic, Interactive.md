RCE stands for remote code execution. Remote code execution = hacker visits a script to run code. Usually this script has been forcefully placed into the server because of an exploit. That script could be php or whatever format that the server supports. The script usually has access to the system server files, eg. PHP by default can run shell scripts and access the storage. There are two types of RCE:
	- Predefined RCE. You uploaded a php file that has predefined shell commands hard-coded. You visit the php file directly. Upon visiting the script, those commands are run on the script's server.
	- Dynamic/Interactive RCE. This occurs when a PHP file is uploaded that reads a URL search parameter—commonly `?cmd`—and passes its value directly to the system shell for execution. Instead of executing only hard-coded or predefined commands, the script runs whatever shell command is supplied by the user through the URL. For example, a hacker can visit the script with `?cmd=whoami` to execute that command on the server. This behavior is also known as **OS Command Injection**, as it allows user-supplied input to control system-level commands.
