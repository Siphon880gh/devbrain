Here’s another powerful example:

### ⚠️ **Case: Facebook (Meta) – Cambridge Analytica Scandal**

#### 🌐 Background:

- In 2014, **Cambridge Analytica**, a political consulting firm, obtained personal data from **up to 87 million Facebook users**.
    
- The data was collected via a personality quiz app that exploited Facebook's lax data-sharing policies—**harvesting not only quiz-takers’ data, but also their friends’**.
    

#### 🚫 Compliance Failures:

- **Lack of user consent**: Facebook allowed third-party developers to access extensive user data without users’ meaningful permission.
    
- **Failure to enforce data use policies**: Facebook knew in 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had violated terms of service but didn’t act swiftly to ensure deletion or inform users.
    
- **Non-compliance with GDPR-like privacy expectations**, even before GDPR enforcement.
    

#### 🧾 Penalties and Fallout:

- In **2019**, the **U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** fined Facebook **$5 billion**, one of the largest penalties ever for privacy violations.
    
- **Facebook had to submit to 20 years of independent privacy audits**.
    
- CEO **Mark Zuckerberg had to personally certify compliance** each quarter or face personal liability.
    

#### 🔻 Business Impact:

- Massive reputational damage.
    
- Public and political backlash.
    
- Facebook was used as a cautionary tale during the global rollout of **GDPR** and **CCPA**, helping fuel stricter data privacy laws.

### 🧠 Lesson:

Even tech giants aren’t immune. **Failure to build privacy and consent mechanisms**—especially in how third parties use data—can lead to **historic fines, legal reforms, and long-term trust erosion**.

Strictly speaking:  
➡️ **Facebook’s actions weren’t a violation of a specific regulatory statute at the time**, like GDPR (which only came into force in 2018) or CCPA.  
But:  
✅ It **did violate the terms of a prior 2012 FTC consent order** regarding misrepresentations of privacy practices — and that **was a compliance breach**.
