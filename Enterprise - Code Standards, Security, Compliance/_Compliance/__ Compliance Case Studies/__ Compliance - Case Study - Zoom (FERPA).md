A well-known example is **Zoom Video Communications**, which faced compliance and privacy scrutiny during its explosive growth in 2020:

### 📉 **Case: Zoom’s Privacy and Security Failures During Pandemic Surge**

#### 🚀 Background:

- In early 2020, as COVID-19 hit, **Zoom** became a household name almost overnight.
    
- The platform's usage skyrocketed from 10 million daily users in December 2019 to over 300 million by April 2020.
    

#### ⚠️ Compliance and Privacy Issues:

Zoom was not originally designed for large-scale public use or education and healthcare applications that required strict data security (like **FERPA** for education and **HIPAA** for healthcare).

Key violations included:

- **Misleading claims** about end-to-end encryption.
    
- **Routing traffic through China**, raising concerns about foreign surveillance.
    
- **“Zoombombing” incidents**, where intruders disrupted calls due to weak default security settings.
    
- **Sharing user data with Facebook and LinkedIn** without proper disclosure.
    

#### 🧾 Regulatory Action:

In **November 2020**, the **U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** settled with Zoom:

- Zoom was **prohibited from making misrepresentations** about its security practices.
    
- Required to implement a **comprehensive security program**, undergo **independent audits** for 20 years, and enhance its data protection measures.
    

#### 💡 Lesson:

Zoom’s rapid growth without scaling its **compliance and security frameworks** exposed it to major reputational and legal risks. Though the company wasn't fined millions, the scrutiny damaged trust and forced costly operational changes under regulatory oversight.

This case is a real-world reminder: **growth before compliance can backfire**—especially when handling sensitive data or operating in regulated industries like healthcare, education, or finance.
