AnÂ **attack pattern**Â is aÂ **reusable method or strategy used by attackers to exploit systems**. It describesÂ **how**Â an attacker might achieve a malicious goal, such as stealing data, escalating privileges, or compromising a system.

> _An attack pattern is a structured description of common techniques used to carry out a cyber attack._

Think of it as aÂ **playbook**Â orÂ **blueprint**Â for how adversaries operate.

### MITRE'S CAPEC is an indexing of attack patterns

**CAPEC (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification):**
- Official catalog of attack patterns
- Helps inÂ **threat modeling**,Â **red teaming**, andÂ **security training**
- **Maintained by MITRE**

**ðŸ§  Example of an Attack Pattern:**
- **CAPEC-137: Parameter Injection**
	- **What it is:**Â An attacker manipulates input parameters in web requests (like URLs or forms).
	- **Used to:**Â Inject malicious code, such as in SQL Injection or Command Injection.
	- **Impact:**Â May allow unauthorized data access or system control.
