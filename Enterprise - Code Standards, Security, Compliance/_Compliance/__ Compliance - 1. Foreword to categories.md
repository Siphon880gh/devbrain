Organizations today must navigate a complex landscape of cybersecurity threats and compliance obligations. Standards like PCI DSS, ISO 27001, and HIPAA establish essential baselines for securing sensitive information. In parallel, tools and frameworks such as CVE identifiers, vulnerability scanners, and the MITRE ATT&CK framework help organizations identify, assess, and respond to potential threats.

We can organize these into Standards and Indexes. 
- **Standards**: A standard provides a framework for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS). Examples: ISO, 
- **Indexes**: Assigns unique identifiers to known security vulnerabilities so that organizations and tools can refer to the same issues consistently.

There are also industry specific standards, usually codified by a law (usually an Act), and usually a body that recommends and another body that governs
- Healthcare has HIPAA the federal laws. But NIST ([http://nist.gov/](http://nist.gov/)) is a U.S. government agency that provides standards and guidance that help organizations comply with HIPAA. HIPAA includes healthcare professionals not accidentally releasing HIPAA protected information on the phone or in-person.  PHI refers to **any** individually identifiable health information, whether it’s **electronic, paper, or oral**. ePHI (Electronic) is **a subset of PHI** — it refers specifically to **PHI that is created, stored, transmitted, or received electronically**. ISO standards (like ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO 27799) help protect both PHI and ePHI — but their focus is mostly on information security, so in practice they emphasize ePHI more.
- Education has FERPA, the federal law that protects student privacy in schools, colleges, and universities receiving U.S. Department of Education funding. If your business or technology platform could potentially expose student PII (personally identifiable information)—such as names, grades, attendance records, or disciplinary actions—it must follow FERPA rules. This applies whether the information is shared orally, on paper, or electronically. Electronic student records are subject to the same protections, and schools often rely on NIST guidance (like NIST SP 800-171) to implement security controls for protecting that data. While “eFERPA” isn’t a formal term like ePHI in healthcare, the same principle applies: electronically stored or transmitted student data must be properly secured.  
  
And related to industry, there are certain protected classes or demographics:
- Children’s privacy is protected under COPPA, which applies to users aged 13 and under. Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram attempt to comply by prohibiting children under 13 from creating accounts. However, this approach is not foolproof—many underage users can simply misrepresent their age during sign-up. To strengthen compliance, platforms should implement, among other strategies, AI-driven systems to detect and flag accounts that may belong to children under 13 based on behavior, content, or language patterns.
