## Usage

Turn on deep research, turn off Web Search, then select Notion at Sources:
![[Pasted image 20250729210900.png]]

If you want answers strictly from your Notion, enter your prompt as so:
```
{YOUR_QUESTION}

Please use only my Notion sources. Make sure to cite the Notion source (eg. What page or database name). If the answer can't be found from Notion, then mention the information cannot be found.
```

If you want your Notion to supplement the AI's answer, enter your prompt as so:
```
{YOUR_QUESTION}

Please use my Notion sources to supplement your answer. Make sure to cite the Notion source (eg. What page or database name) if you use my sources.
```


At the right side panel is the sources:
