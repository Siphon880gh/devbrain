Is this ok writing? I strive in jumping into different environments and hitting the floor running.

Your writing is clear, but there are a couple of ways to make it smoother:

1. "Strive" typically means to make efforts towards a goal. In this context, you might mean "thrive," which indicates that you do well in those situations.
2. The idiom is typically "hit the ground running."

A revised version could be:

"I thrive in jumping into different environments and hitting the ground running."

This conveys that you're adept at quickly adapting and performing in new situations.
