Generating a cold email offer as a freelance web development service while educating them on their needs


<<
I am cold emailing a specific industry whose business I've researched. I want to critique their design in terms of spacing and colors, their copyright in terms of wording and what appears in sequence on the page, and SEO and performance, and the lack of accessibility which make make them liable to frivolous lawsuits. Help me craft an email example where I introduce my role, how I can generally improve their business leads and conversion, where I laid out my critique, what I can offer, and the consequences of not following my suggestions. Suggest that they can implement these suggestions now that they have a direction but that with me it would be a lot easier and I could offer a reasonable negotiable rate.

Please add that I also specialize in web design and web development and coding. Please make it obvious from the email headings or starting sentence about "The consequence of..." consequences.
