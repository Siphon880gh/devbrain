### 🔵 **Google Flow (Veo on Flow)**

Google Flow is the interface that currently hosts **Veo**, Google’s most advanced **text-to-video model** as of mid-2025.

- ✅ **Text-to-Video:**  
    Yes. You input a prompt (e.g., “a surfer riding a big wave during sunset”) and it generates a short high-quality video.
- ✅ **Image-to-Video (Image Conditioning):**  
    Yes. You can **upload an image** to influence the look/style of the generated video (e.g., to maintain consistent visual design or structure).

> 🔹 _So Flow (via Veo) supports both: **Text-to-Video** and **Image-conditioned Video.**_
