You may want to login in the virtual desktop for AI to take over Google Sheet, Google Doc, Notion, etc.

Usually ChatGPT Agent will pause the virtual desktop, then ask you to do so with a login button rendered in the chat. But you can definitely take control of the virtual desktop anytime to browse to your website then log in - and when ChatGPT Agent asks what you've done after relinquishing control, let it know that its now logged in to Google sheet / Notion / etc.

You could also preemptively instruct ChatGPT Agent to ask you to login along with the instructions on what ChatGPT Agent will be doing for you. That example at [[ChatGPT Agent Uses Google Sheet (Asks you to login)]].

Here's an example of ChatGPT Agent realizing you need to login for it to create in your Notion. It pauses the virtual desktop and also summarizes what it found from the virtual desktop session, then finally, it gives you a Log in button:

Clicking the "Log in" button takes you to the virtual browser with you in control. Go login. Then you can relinquish control. It'll continue agentically performing tasks and deep thinking to help perform your goals
