What is ChatGPT Agent
## TL;DR

ChatGPT Agent just lets you take control over its virtual browser that it uses to demonstrate its deep thinking (you can give control back to ChatGPT later, then it will resume agentically from your work):

It's for web ChatGPT as of July 2025 (Mac ChatGPT does have Agent mode but doesn't let you take over).

For this primer, I'll use this prompt formula:
```
Help me research competitors for my startup {STARTUP_NAME} which is a {DESCRIBE_BUSINESS_AND_CUSTOMERS}.
```

## Reworded

What is ChatGPT Agent:

- Does deep research but shows you step by step how it looks up the internet through a playback of the ChatGPT Agent user using a virtual desktop and usually involving a virtual web browser
- As an agent, the AI is trained on how to interact with various tools, such as Google Sheet, Notion, etc. As a ChatGPT Agent, it's trained on how to interact with GUI's too.
- You can usurp control at anytime in the virtual ChatGPT Agent user session, and then give control back to the Agent, enabling you to course correct if the ChatGPT Agent is failing at a task.
- The Agent might ask you to take control (eg. Login on a webpage at the virtual web browser before it can perform other tasks)

## How it looks / how to use

Basically it shows a webpage simulation in your Chat Thread (Web, Chrome)

First it will think, then starts setting up a virtual desktop:
![[Pasted image 20250726012552.png]]

Then it will start performing user actions in the virtual desktop
- Could be web surfing
- Could be browsing a webpage
- Could run code in the terminal to create a csv output, then piping that to a csv file it can use (eg. Import into Google Sheets, as per [[ChatGPT Agent Uses Google Sheet (Asks you to login)]])
![[Pasted image 20250726012533.png]]


It actually opens webpages it finds online. Here it's showing a webpage that's about to load:
![[Pasted image 20250726012747.png]]


Letting you SEE what it thinks and does (Definition of AI Agent is it has tools like web browser, etc):
![[Pasted image 20250726012830.png]]


Then you can **t**ake **c**ontrol at anytime (clicking the … at the top right). So you can manually do whatever you want instead of letting Chat do the research/tasks. You can give back control to the chat any moment.  
  
How it looks:

tc 2 of 2:
- Here's me taking control because I didn't like what I was seeing (the webpage going to 502 in the virtual desktop window). I can take over and browse something else on Google Search, then relinquish control for ChatGPT Agent to continue its work.
![[Pasted image 20250726013205.png]]

When it's done using the virtual computer, the virtual computer window will collapse under a message "Worked for X minutes". You can expand it to show a video you can replay. However, you can't download the video, as of July 2025.

Also after it's done working, it'll give a summary of what it's done and any interpretation in the usual text reply format.

Discussion - OpenAI Introducing ChatGPT Agent:

I think it’s a smart move by OpenAI because you can “see” how the AI thinks which can really  hype up ChatGPT. And if you take over the simulated window because you don't like where the virtual desktop agentic user is going, then you’re training AI on how to do the deep thinking and research better. Great for investment and also to have us (the human users) train the AI.
