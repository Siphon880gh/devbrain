Let's say you're using an online prompt optimizer. You want to reverse engineer how their prompt might have worked behind the curtains.

You know that you have two inputs:
- Your unoptimized prompt
- Their outputted optimized prompt

This is a case study of how you would think through the prompts in order to have AI reverse engineer what could be the prompts that powers the prompt optimizer app.

First prompt:
```
You are an expert Prompt Reverse Engineer and Algorithmic Analyst. Your primary function is to analyze the transformation process between an initial user prompt (Prompt A) and a resulting optimized prompt (Prompt B) generated by an advanced prompt optimization tool. You must deduce the underlying logic, rules, or algorithms the tool employed to achieve this transformation.  
  
Your core task is to reverse engineer the optimization logic demonstrated by the provided example. Specifically, analyze how Prompt A was converted into Prompt B. The analysis should focus on identifying the structural, stylistic, and instructional changes made by the optimization tool. Furthermore, generalize this deduced logic so that it can be applied flexibly to *any* future user prompt (Prompt A) to generate a corresponding optimized prompt (Prompt B). Consider the possibility that the optimization tool uses multiple distinct algorithms based on the detected nature or intent of Prompt A.  
  
The analysis must strictly incorporate the specific example provided, treating the transformation from A to B as the primary data point for algorithm deduction.   
  
**Specific Example Data:**  
*   **Prompt A (Input):** """For sections that are just lists, make sure to either have an intro paragraph leading into the list OR expand the section so it reads more like part of an article rather than a list. Choose whichever makes sense in the narrative flow (for example, if reader expects a list or it's better explained in paragraph forms).Article___"""  
*   **Prompt B (Output/Optimized Example):** """You are an expert Content Editor and Stylist specializing in narrative flow and article structure. Your primary goal is to refine provided text segments to ensure high readability and seamless integration within a larger article.The main objective is to review and revise sections of an article that currently consist only of lists. For any section identified as a simple list, you must apply one of two structural improvements to enhance the narrative quality.When revising a list section, adhere strictly to the following conditional logic:1. **Option A (Introductory Paragraph):** If the list format is appropriate or expected by the reader, precede the list with a concise introductory paragraph that sets the context and leads smoothly into the bullet points.2. **Option B (Narrative Expansion):** If the content is better served by continuous prose, expand the list items into full, flowing sentences and paragraphs, integrating them naturally into the surrounding article text.**Constraint:** The choice between Option A and Option B must be dictated solely by what best serves the overall 'narrative flow' of the article.The specific instruction to follow is: "For sections that are just lists, make sure to either have an intro paragraph leading into the list OR expand the section so it reads more like part of an article rather than a list. Choose whichever makes sense in the narrative flow (for example, if reader expects a list or it's better explained in paragraph forms)."""  
  
The final deduced logic must be presented as a generalized, flexible framework capable of optimizing *any* input prompt (Prompt A) into a high-quality, structured output prompt (Prompt B). Do not output the optimized prompt itself; output the *methodology* for creating it.
```

Subsequently, prompt in the same chat thread:
```
I want to reverse engineer how a prompt optimizer tool is able to take user's prompt A and produce an optimized prompt B 

A:
"""
For sections that are just lists, make sure to either have an intro paragraph leading into the list OR expand the section so it reads more like part of an article rather than a list. Choose whichever makes sense in the narrative flow (for example, if reader expects a list or it's better explained in paragraph forms). 

Article ___
"""

B: 
"""
You are an expert Content Editor and Stylist specializing in narrative flow and article structure. Your primary goal is to refine provided text segments to ensure high readability and seamless integration within a larger article.

The main objective is to review and revise sections of an article that currently consist only of lists. For any section identified as a simple list, you must apply one of two structural improvements to enhance the narrative quality. 

When revising a list section, adhere strictly to the following conditional logic:

1. **Option A (Introductory Paragraph):** If the list format is appropriate or expected by the reader, precede the list with a concise introductory paragraph that sets the context and leads smoothly into the bullet points. 

2. **Option B (Narrative Expansion):** If the content is better served by continuous prose, expand the list items into full, flowing sentences and paragraphs, integrating them naturally into the surrounding article text.

**Constraint:** The choice between Option A and Option B must be dictated solely by what best serves the overall 'narrative flow' of the article. 

The specific instruction to follow is: "For sections that are just lists, make sure to either have an intro paragraph leading into the list OR expand the section so it reads more like part of an article rather than a list.

"""

And I want this flexible enough that it works for any prompts. Consider that it may be possible there is more than one algorithm depending on the type of prompt it detects?
```

  
Then finally at the same chat thread:
```
Ok great. Looking at the previous prompt only, rewrite it into a prompt I can feed another AI agent along with my prompt that needs optimization. It will perform all the steps necessary then output the optimized prompt in a json object that also explains the optimizations done   
  
{ aboutOptimizations: "..",  
 optimizedPrompt: .. }   
  
Your prompt would have the AI agent at aboutOptimizations, explain what optimizations were done
```
