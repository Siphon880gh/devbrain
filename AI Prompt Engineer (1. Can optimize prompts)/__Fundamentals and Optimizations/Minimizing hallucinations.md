**METHODS:**

You _can_ influence ChatGPT’s **temperament**, **creativity**, and overall **response style** using your prompt. While you can't directly set a "creativity level" (unless you're using the API and setting `temperature`), you can guide the output in natural language.

**🔧 To Adjust Temperament (e.g. tone, formality, emotional level):**

Use phrases like:

- “Answer calmly and professionally.”
    
- “Use a neutral, concise tone.”
    
- “Keep it lighthearted and friendly.”
    
- “Avoid strong opinions; respond diplomatically.”

**🎨 To Adjust Creativity:**

- **Lower creativity / more factual, grounded:**
    
    > “Give a straightforward, fact-based response with no fluff.”  
    > “Stick to well-known knowledge only.”  
    > “Don’t speculate — cite real examples.”
    
- **Higher creativity / brainstorming:**
    
    > “Think outside the box and propose unconventional ideas.”  
    > “Be imaginative and give 3 different creative approaches.”  
    > “Suggest some playful, unexpected ideas.”

**🧠 Other "Personality" Controls:**

- **Concise vs Detailed**
    
    > “Give a short, to-the-point summary.”  
    > “Explain in detail as if to someone new to the topic.”
    
- **Role-Based Prompting**
    
    > “Act as a seasoned business strategist.”  
    > “Respond like a skeptical editor reviewing a draft.”  
    > “Pretend you’re a startup founder pitching this.”
