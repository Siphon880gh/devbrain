Let's go through this scenario:


**Q:** Clearbit Reveal identifies anonymous website visitors and matches them to companies
**A**:
> Yes — what you're describing is commonly referred to as **reverse IP lookup**, **website visitor intelligence**, or **de-anonymization via tracking pixel + IP enrichment**.
> 
> ### 🧠 What Clearbit Reveal Does
> 
> Clearbit Reveal and similar tools place a **tracking script or pixel** on your site. When a visitor lands on your website:
> 
> 1. Their **IP address** is captured.
>     
> 2. The service matches the IP to a company (via IP-to-company databases).
>     
> 3. Optionally, it can enrich the result with **firmographics** (industry, size, tech stack) and sometimes **person-level data** if cookies or past data are linked.
