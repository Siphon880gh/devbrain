If ChatGPT gives you:
- A long checklist
- A sequence of tasks
- An algorithmic process
- A workflow or system template
    

**Then ask it to convert that output into a Notion template** with:
- Suggested **column properties** (e.g. Select, Status, Date, Checkbox)
- Recommended **view types** (e.g. Table, Board, Calendar)


This helps you turn abstract ideas into actionable, organized systems directly usable in Notion.
