### 📝 How to Get ChatGPT to Update Its Previous Answer

If you ask ChatGPT a follow-up question and want the **new info added into the previous response**, use a prompt like:

> "…and incorporate into the above response."

#### Why This Works:

Behind the scenes, ChatGPT sees your entire conversation as one long text thread — including all your **previous questions and its responses**. So when you say “the above response,” it knows what you’re referring to.

#### Tip:
Be specific. Instead of just asking a new question, say:

> "Can you update the article above to include this point..."

This makes your intent clear and helps ChatGPT give a cleaner, integrated result.
