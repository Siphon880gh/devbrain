TryShortcut.ai (https://www.tryshortcut.ai/)—also known simply as Shortcut—functions like a powerful AI analyst for your spreadsheets, whether you're starting with a blank sheet, typing a description, or uploading a file. Let’s break down the input methods clearly:

#### 1. Start from an Empty Sheet

Ideal for building new models, dashboards, or reports from scratch.  
You can:

- **Provide your data directly in the prompt**—especially useful when the dataset is small.  
    For example:
    > “Q1 sales: 1000, 1500, 1300. Calculate growth and plot a trend.”

- **Refer to tables or values already typed into the sheet**:
    > “Use the data to make a bar chart.”

- Or **let the AI prompt you with clarifying questions** if more information is needed.  

#### 2. Upload an Existing Spreadsheet (e.g., .xlsx, .xlsm, .csv)

Upload your file, and Shortcut preserves all formulas and formatting—then you continue by just instructing the AI via chat.

These are not separate “modes”—just two ways to feed the AI your data:

- **Input through text or referencing in a blank sheet**, or
- **Input through file upload**

Both approaches funnel into the same interactive chat workflow.

### Streamlined Workflow in Practice

**Step 1: Choose how to provide your data**
- **Empty sheet + text**: “Here’s my sample data…”
- **Empty sheet + existing cell data**: “Use what’s already in the sheet.”
- **Upload file**: Bring in your spreadsheet.

**Step 2: Chat with Shortcut**  
Ask it to clean data, summarize, analyze trends, or build visuals. It may ask you follow-up questions to clarify if needed. 

**Step 3: Watch the AI work in real time**  
See results unfold in the spreadsheet while retaining full Excel functionality. 

**Step 4: Refine or revert**
- Manually edit cells or formatting.
- Continue the conversation (“Add chart”, “Clean Sheet2”).
- Use “Return to checkpoint” to rollback Shortcut actions, or Ctrl/Cmd + Z for manual edits.

### Sample Prompts to Try

- **Empty sheet + prompt**:
    > “Here’s revenue for Jan–Mar: 200, 300, 250. Please calculate the average and plot a line chart.”
    
- **Using existing table**:
    > “Use the table to highlight the top three months.”
    
- **Uploading first, then instructing**:  
    Upload `sales_data.xlsx`, then ask:
    > “Remove outliers, create a pivot by region, and add a bar chart of performance.”
