Google Labs **Flow** (powered by **Veo**) allows you to transform a **still image into a cinematic motion video** with depth, realism, and polish. Using the right prompt language—especially **camera terminology**—can make a big difference in how your video turns out.

If you want to simulate **3D motion with parallax depth**, using terms like **dolly**, **pan**, **tilt**, and **pedestal** helps direct Flow’s motion engine more effectively.

## 🎯 What You Can Do

✅ Animate a **still image** with **illusion of depth**  
✅ Simulate **cinematic camera movement**  
✅ Add emotion and drama to photos  
✅ Mimic shots seen in **movies, documentaries, or ads**

## 🧠 Key Camera Movement Terms to Use in Prompts

Use these correctly to guide how Flow animates your image.

| Term                        | Motion Direction       | What It Does                                                                                                   | Prompt Usage Example                               |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pan**                     | **Rotates** left/right | Camera **rotates horizontally** in place (like turning your head). Back of camera does not translate in space. | _"slow pan across the skyline"_                    |
| **Tilt**                    | **Rotates** up/down    | Camera **rotates vertically** in place (like nodding your head). Back of camera does not translate in space.   | _"tilt upward to reveal the spire"_                |
| **Dolly**                   | **Moves** forward/back | Entire camera **moves in/out**, creates zoom effect with parallax                                              | _"dolly-in toward the subject for dramatic depth"_ |
| **Truck**                   | **Moves** side-to-side | Camera **slides left/right**, good for horizontal parallax                                                     | _"truck left across the landscape"_                |
| **Pedestal** (aka **Boom**) | **Moves** up/down      | Entire camera **rises or drops vertically** (like on a crane)                                                  | _"pedestal up to follow the tower's height"_       |

### ✨ Pan vs. Pedestal: Don’t Confuse Them

- **Pan** = camera stays still, just rotates left/right
- **Pedestal** = camera **moves vertically** while staying level

> Think of **pan** like turning your head.  
> Think of **pedestal** like standing on an elevator.

## 🧪 Prompt Formula (Template)

```plaintext
A [subject or scene], transformed into a cinematic 3D parallax video with realistic depth simulation. Simulate a smooth [camera movement] through the scene. Add [lighting/shadow] for realism. Style: [film/art style].
```

---

## ✍️ Prompt Examples

### 🎭 Portrait with Emotional Dolly

> A high-resolution photo of an elderly man with deep wrinkles and a thoughtful expression. Create a cinematic 3D parallax video with a **slow dolly-in** toward his eyes, enhancing emotional intensity. Add soft shadows for depth. Style: film noir.

---

### 🏞️ Landscape with Truck Motion

> A sunrise over a misty forest valley. Turn it into a parallax-style 3D video using a **truck left movement**, revealing layered trees and distant hills. Add light rays and morning fog. Style: nature documentary.

---

### 🏙️ Cityscape with Tilt and Pan

> A night skyline of a futuristic city. Simulate a **pan right and tilt up** motion to reveal the skyline. Add glowing lights, neon reflections, and atmospheric haze. Style: cyberpunk.

---

### 🕍 Architecture with Pedestal Up

> A gothic cathedral courtyard at dusk. Animate a **pedestal up** camera movement to follow the tower’s architecture as it rises. Add dramatic light glows and volumetric haze. Style: cinematic drama.

---

## 🧩 Bonus Enhancers to Add in Prompts

- **"depth-aware parallax"** or **"layered depth"**
    
- **"volumetric lighting"**
    
- **"soft film grain"**
    
- **"subtle motion blur"**
    
- **"realistic lens effects"** (e.g., **anamorphic**, **rack focus**)
    

---

## 🛠 Tips for Best Results

- Focus on **clear subjects** with foreground/background separation
    
- Use **only one camera direction per prompt** for clarity
    
- Choose **high-quality, detailed photos**
    
- Keep your prompt **visual, cinematic, and grounded in real-world movement**

## 🧠 Summary

|Motion Type|Use it for…|
|---|---|
|**Pan / Tilt**|Rotating the camera in place to reframe the subject|
|**Dolly / Truck / Pedestal**|Moving the camera through 3D space to simulate depth|

The better you **describe the intended motion**, the more Flow can generate something that feels immersive and cinematic.
