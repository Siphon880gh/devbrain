#### ⚙️ **Self-Hosted Botpress v12**
- **There is no `bp` CLI** — just run the server and modify files locally.
    
#### ☁️ **Botpress Cloud (Modern & Maintained)**
- The `bp` CLI is **optional**, and tied to the cloud platform.
- You can manage your bots directly on https://app.botpress.cloud — no CLI needed.
- The CLI offers a **developer-friendly terminal workflow**:
    - Create and manage bots from the terminal.
    - Push or pull bots between your local machine and the cloud.
    - Open the Studio in the browser.
    - _(Experimental)_: Chat with your bot via CLI to simulate user interaction.
