You may get prompted to run `bp login` on your terminal. It'll ask your password / personal access token.

To create personal access token, go to

Continuing.. you entered your personal access token

It asks:
? **Which workspace do you want to login to?** › 
❯   Weng Fei Fung's Workspace

End with logged in:
```
✔ **Enter your Personal Access Token** … bp_pat_kkbVPtJh4oZnouQQ8sgokkre7wAdSAclyaEu
✔ **Which workspace do you want to login to?** › Weng Fei Fung's Workspace
✔ Logged In
```

You're kicked back into your shell.

Now you can run more bp commands without asking to login again.
