BrowserStack is a cloud-based testing platform that gives developers instant, browser-in-browser access to **3,000+ desktop/OS combinations and 20,000+ real iOS & Android devices** for both manual (“Live” / “App Live”) and automated (“Automate” / “App Automate”) tests. Its unified dashboard also offers Percy visual-regression testing, Accessibility Testing, Test Management, Low-Code Automation, and CI/CD integrations with parallel execution—so teams can ship cross-browser-safe code without owning their own device lab.
