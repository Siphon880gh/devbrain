**Package Mangers:**
NPM (Node Package Manager) is considered a package manager. It is used primarily for managing dependencies in JavaScript and Node.js environments. NPM allows users to install, update, and manage libraries and packages from the npm registry.

**Bundlers:**
On the other hand, a bundler is a tool that bundles together JavaScript and other resources, like CSS and images, into a single or a few files, typically for use in a browser. Examples of bundlers include Webpack, Parcel, and Rollup. These tools differ from NPM in that they focus on preparing code for deployment by optimizing and combining files, rather than managing and installing packages
