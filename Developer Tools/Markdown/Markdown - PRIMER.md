**Markdown** lets you format text using simple characters, making your writing easy to style without relying on complex software. For example, you might type:

```
# Title

Hi how's it going, **John Doe**?
```

But when rendered (such as published online or you turn no reading mode), the reader sees:

> # Title
> 
> Hi how's it going, **John Doe**?

**Why use Markdown?**

- It enables automation and makes it easy for code to work with your documents.
- You're not locked into proprietary tools like Microsoft Word.
- You keep full control of your filesâ€”ideal for tools like **Obsidian**, where your notes live on your own computer without sacrificing formatting.
- You won't have compatibility issues in the future because Markdown is pretty stable.
