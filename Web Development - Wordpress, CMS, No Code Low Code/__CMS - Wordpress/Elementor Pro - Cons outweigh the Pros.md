Elementor Pro makes it easy for clients to add in popups (rather than through popup plugins). You can have buttons and links that open popups. You can have popups when user's leaving.

But it's constantly bugging out in the middle of production lifecycle unlike WPBakery and Salient. Likely due to other PHP updates and plugin updates that cause immediate conflict. This could lead to production websites suddenly not loading because of critical errors

Elementor Pro, a popular WordPress page builder plugin, does make it easier for users to create and manage popups directly within its interface. This functionality reduces the need for separate popup plugins. With Elementor Pro, you can:

1. **Add Buttons and Links to Trigger Popups:** You can easily link buttons or text links to trigger popups. This can be useful for various purposes like sign-up forms, promotional content, or important notifications.

2. **Create Exit-Intent Popups:** Elementor Pro allows you to create popups that appear when the user is about to leave the page (known as exit-intent popups). This feature can be effective in capturing leads or providing last-minute offers to keep the user engaged.

3. **Design Custom Popups:** Unlike many basic popup plugins, Elementor Pro offers extensive customization options. You can design popups that match your site's aesthetic and meet specific user experience goals.

4. **Targeting and Triggering Options:** Elementor Pro provides various options for targeting and triggering popups. You can set popups to appear on specific pages, to certain users, after a set duration, or based on other user interactions.

5. **Integration with Forms and Other Widgets:** Since it's part of the Elementor ecosystem, the popups can seamlessly integrate with Elementor's forms, images, texts, and other widgets for a cohesive design and functionality.

These features make Elementor Pro a versatile tool for creating popups without relying on additional plugins.
