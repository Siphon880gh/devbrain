In WPBakery, when editing a webpage on the frontend there are green, blue, and orange tiles that gives me options. I think one tile was a block, one title was heading, another tile for content. What are those?

In WPBakery Page Builder (formerly known as Visual Composer), the page elements are represented by colored tiles or blocks in the front-end editor. These colors and tiles are part of the user interface that allows users to identify different types of content elements and manage them accordingly. Here's what they generally signify:

1. **Green Tiles:** These usually represent row elements. Rows are the primary structural elements that contain columns and thus create the layout grid on your page.

2. **Blue Tiles:** These are typically for column elements. Columns are placed inside rows and are used to hold content elements like text, images, videos, etc. You can usually adjust the size of columns to create different layouts.

3. **Orange Tiles:** These represent individual content elements such as text blocks, headings, images, buttons, and other specific features you can add to your page.

Each of these tiles comes with a set of options when you hover over or click on them. You might see:

- A pencil icon, which allows you to edit the element's settings.
- A clone icon, for duplicating the element.
- A cross arrow icon, for moving the element.
- A trash can icon, for deleting the element.

For example, when you click on a "heading" tile, you'll be able to edit the text, change the tag (H1, H2, H3, etc.), alter font sizes, colors, and more. Similarly, a "text block" tile will allow you to add and format body text or any other information you want to include in that section.

It's also possible that specific themes or plugins may add their own elements to WPBakery Page Builder, so you might see different colors or types of tiles depending on the additional functionalities they provide.

To get the best understanding of how these tiles work and what they represent, it's recommended to review the official WPBakery Page Builder documentation or any tooltips/instructions provided within the plugin as you hover over or interact with these elements.
