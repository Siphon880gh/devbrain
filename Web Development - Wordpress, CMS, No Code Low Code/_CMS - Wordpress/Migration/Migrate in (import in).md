Let's say you have a .wpress file because you had exported (can be many hundred megabytes huge)

Firstly, setup a fresh installation of wordpress at your desired folder. For information on how to install a new wordpress, refer to [[_ Wordpress PRIMER]] and there are instructions on setting up the database user credentials if necessary

Your installation wizard could look like this:
![](reZNk1g.png)
^ Yes you can do "localhost:3306". 
^ Yes, notice the wp_ is repeated twice. That can cause confusion. It isn't erroneous though. But maybe you should keep it blank. For more information, refer to [[_ Wordpress - Multiple wordpress websites sharing the same database]]
^ Need troubleshooting? May want to spell out the host if localhost doesnt work (localhost usually works even on remote servers though). You may want to test your database credentials using `mysql -u USERNAME -p` then interactively typing the password, while in the SSH terminal.

You may need to have created the database at PHPMyAdmin or MySQL shell

You may need to create users. 

If on CloudPanel, you may create the database and/or user in the CloudPanel. Regardless PHPMyAdmin/MYSQLShell/CloudPanel, result is pretty similar. 

Here's the Cloudpanel where you can create databases and/or users:

You may need to grant all tables to a database user. Refer to [[_ Wordpress PRIMER]] which includes the SQL command to do so (CloudPanel isn't matured enough to handle specific privileges of database users)

Now that your Wordpress is finished setting up, go **install All-in-One WP Migration** on this new fresh copy of wordpress. We will import in your .wpress file (from exporting) to replace the current new wordpress.

Now go to Import:

Clicking file, if you notice:

Then you have network limits to fix. Refer to in that case: [[All-In-One WP Migration Plugin not working, poss network limits]]

---

Then, it will start importing from 0% to 100%. If PHP 7 vs 8, you may get this warning message but it's ok
