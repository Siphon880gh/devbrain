### When to Use a Shared Database

- When you have limited database availability (e.g., hosting plans with restrictions).
### Pros of Using One Database

- Simplified database management.
- Easier backups since all data is in a single database.

### Cons of Using One Database

- The database size grows faster, which might affect performance.
- All sites share the same database, so corruption or errors in the database could potentially impact all sites.

^ Yes, notice the wp_ is repeated twice. That can cause confusion. It isn't erroneous though if the website is indeed related to wordpress

However when installing another wordpress like for say ai lessons wordpress website, you may set the table prefix as `ai_`

So when setting up multiple WordPress installations using the same database, you can use the **same database name**, but you need to ensure that each installation uses a **unique table prefix**.

So you could have wordpress websites at https://domain.tld/site1 and https://domain.tld/site2, and if you look at MySQL shell or PHPMyAdmin (Interface for MySQL), you see one database but with tables differentiated by the prefix that represents your site1 (let's say wp_) and site2 (let's say ai_) under the same database (which could be wp_wordpress_test if following the same screenshot above):
```
   - `wp_posts`

   - `wp_users`

   - `wp_options`

   - ...

   - `ai_posts`

   - `ai_users`

   - `ai_options`

   - ...
```
