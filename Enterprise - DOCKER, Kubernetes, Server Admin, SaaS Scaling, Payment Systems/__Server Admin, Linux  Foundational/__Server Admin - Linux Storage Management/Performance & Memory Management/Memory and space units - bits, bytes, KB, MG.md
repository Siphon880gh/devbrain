Memory and space units - bits, bytes, KB, MG
- 8 bits = 1 byte
- 1,024 bytes = 1 Kilobyte (KB)
- 1,024 Kilobytes (KB) = 1 Megabyte (MB)
- 1,024 Megabytes (MB) = 1 Gigabyte (GB)

This pattern continues with 1,024 Gigabytes equaling 1 Terabyte (TB), and so on, following the binary system commonly used in computing to represent data sizes.
