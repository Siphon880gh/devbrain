GOAL: Our .env file's environmental variables are passed into the containers started by docker-compose.yml

Requirement: You finished the code for the previous challenge.

---

We will use the code from the previous challenge

Let's add a new file `.env`:
```
test=789
```


Let's remove the environmental variables inputted into docker-compose.yml. Then replace it with env_files:
```
version: "3.8"
services:
  env-dc:
    build:
      context: .
    env_file:
      - .env
```

Let's build the image and run it as a virtual container using one Docker Compose command:
```
docker compose up
```
^ Note we removed the "-d" detached/daemon/background mode because we want to see the output in the terminal.

Your output should look like:
```
Hello, thanks for feeding env variables directly at the Dockerfile. I can read env variable "test" and its value is: 789
```
