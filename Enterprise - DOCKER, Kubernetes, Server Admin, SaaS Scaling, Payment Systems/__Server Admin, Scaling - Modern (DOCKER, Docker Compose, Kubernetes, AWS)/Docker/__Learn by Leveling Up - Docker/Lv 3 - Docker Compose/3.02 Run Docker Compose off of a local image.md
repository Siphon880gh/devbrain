Goal: Have Docker Compose run on an existing image that has already been built before.

Recall that docker-compose.yml both builds and runs containers. It can also simply just run containers. Let's build an image with regular `docker` command. Then we configure the file docker-compose.yml to only run the local image.

Build an image of the express app that timestamps your `localhost:3002/` or `localhost:3003/` visits to `./logs/visited.log` either from [[3.01 Run Docker Compose off of Dockerfile]] or [[1.08 Mounting container read and write to host folder]].

Make sure your terminal is in the folder that has the Dockerfile. There may be a docker-compose.yml from the previous challenge but that's irrelevant to us.

Run (Don't worry if same image name, it'll overwrite):
```
docker build -t express-app .
```

Verify that the image exists with Docker:
```
docker images
```

Now in an EMPTY FOLDER, create file `docker-compose.yml`:
![[Pasted image 20250303185421.png]]

Fill in contents for `docker-compose.yml`:
```
version: "3.8"
services:
  express-app:
    image: express-app:latest
    ports:
      - "3003:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./logs:/app/logs
```

Create logs/visited.log:
```
```
^ Create a logs/ folder. Optionally you could create an empty visited.log file.

So the folder now looks like:
![[Pasted image 20250303194315.png]]

Run docker compose up on the docker-compose.yml file:
```
docker compose up -d
```

Visit in web browser: `http://localhost:3003/` to log a visit timestamp

Visit in web browser: `http://localhost:3003/visited` or open `./logs/visited.log` to see the timestamps.

If all works well, please kill the container and you may proceed with the next step.
