This is important to know whenever you change the code because `docker compose up` will use a cached copy.

### When to Use It:

- If youâ€™ve made changes to the `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, or any dependencies in your project, using `--build` ensures that the containers run with the updated image instead of reusing an old cached one.
- Useful when updating dependencies in `requirements.txt` (for Python), `package.json` (for Node.js), or any system packages.

## Force Docker Compose to re-build

Command to force re-build on Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Explanation:

- `docker-compose up`: This command starts and runs the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
- `--build`: This flag forces Docker to rebuild the images before starting the containers.

### Equivalent Commands:

Instead of running:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

You could manually run:

```bash
docker-compose build  # Build or rebuild services
docker-compose up     # Start the services
```

But `docker-compose up --build` does both in a single step.
