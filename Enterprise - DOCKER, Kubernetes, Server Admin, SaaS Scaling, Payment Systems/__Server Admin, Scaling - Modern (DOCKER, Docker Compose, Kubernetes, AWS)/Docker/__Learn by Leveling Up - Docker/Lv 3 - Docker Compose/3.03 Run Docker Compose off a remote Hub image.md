Goal: We'll push the express app that logs timestamps onto the Hub as an image anyone can download. Then we'll use the docker-compose.yml to DOWNLOAD, BUILD, and RUN.

Firstly, make sure all images and containers referring to the express app are removed and killed off to ensure docker-compose.yml doesn't get to run from any local images or that we inadvertently mistaken a still running container as a success on this challenge.

Remove Images:
```
docker images
```

```
docker rmi IMAGE_OR_CONAINER_NAME
```

Kill Containers:
```
docker ps
```

```
docker kill CONTAINER_ID
```
