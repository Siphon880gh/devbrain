There are generally two types of PostgreSQL setups when using Docker Compose:

1. **Using the Host's PostgreSQL** (No PostgreSQL service in `docker-compose.yml`):
    
    - The PostgreSQL instance running on your host machine is completely separate from any Docker container.
    - The **Dockerized application** (e.g., an Express.js app) can connect to the host's PostgreSQL:
        - Use `localhost` if running `app.js` directly on your machine.
        - Use `host.docker.internal` if running `app.js` inside a Docker container. This is a special Docker DNS name that allows containers to communicate with the host machine.
    - You will need to use your existing PostgreSQL credentials.
2. **Using a Dockerized PostgreSQL** (Defined in `docker-compose.yml`):
    
    - This setup runs PostgreSQL as a service inside a Docker container.
    - The application inside the same `docker-compose` network can connect using the **service name** (e.g., `postgres`) instead of `localhost`.
    - To ensure the database persists across container restarts, you need to:
        - **Mount a volume** for PostgreSQL data (e.g., `./pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data`).
        - If your Dockerized app requires data in the database to function, initialize the database by manually seeding tables using a Dockerized script that accesses the same PostgreSQL volume on the same host, or execute a custom startup script inside your app's container that inserts seed data.
