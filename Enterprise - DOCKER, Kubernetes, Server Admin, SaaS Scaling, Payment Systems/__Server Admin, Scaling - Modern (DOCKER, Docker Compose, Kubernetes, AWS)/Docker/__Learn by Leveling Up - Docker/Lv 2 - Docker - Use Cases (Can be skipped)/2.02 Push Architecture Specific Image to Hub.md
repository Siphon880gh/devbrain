This challenge can be skipped if you don't plan on making your images available to download from command line, Dockerfile, docker compose files (covered in future challenges), etc.

However, if you choose to continue this challenge, you must have completed challenge 1.8 with the code ready.

Sign up for a Docker account if havenâ€™t yet at
https://app.docker.com/signup

Recommended you use plain signup instead of OAuth2

At the terminal, run docker login  or docker login -u USERNAME

You don't need to know the exact location of the image file built on your computer in order to share it, however you need to have the image already built on the system because the push command will find the image file and upload it for you. You can find the image name if you don't remember it by running:
```
docker images
```

You tag an already existing image then map it to your username and desired remote repo name like this (Assuming we are using the previous challenge's image).
```
docker tag inq-app USERNAME/inq-app
```
^ Make sure to replace with your username
^ It succeeds if there's no messages or errors

Once tagged, then you may push to the Docker Hub:
```
docker push USERNAME/inq-app
```


Once pushed, you can check your repository online at:
https://hub.docker.com/r/USERNAME/inq-app

You can see all your pushed repos by visiting your Docker profile:
https://hub.docker.com/u/USERNAME

Keep in mind that the image is tied to your system's architecture. Then that means uesrs downloading your image needs to have the same architecture chip as yours. Docker images are architecture-dependent. If you build an image on an `amd64` machine (e.g., most desktop PCs), it won't run on an `arm64` machine (e.g., Raspberry Pi or Apple M1/M2 Mac) unless you explicitly build it for multiple architectures.

That's why on DockerHub (https://hub.docker.com/search?q=amd&badges=verified_publisher), you have some authors that suffix their image repo names like so:

![[Pasted image 20250303020824.png]]
Notice DataDog (a well known company for observability service for cloud apps) has deprecated their AMD64 for a Multi-Arch (Aka Multi-Architecture) image.

There is now a newer solution (sorta) that lets you build images that can be compatible across different architectures. Docker just hasn't adopted multi-arch as the default.

>[!note] History
>- Docker **could** emulate different architectures using `qemu`, but this was slow and not practical for production use. Docker Buildx was introduced as an experimental feature in 2019 to solve the multi-arch problem. Instead of relying on emulation, Buildx uses QEMU and BuildKit to allow cross-compilation and build images for different architectures simultaneously. By 2021, Buildx became more stable, and now it's the recommended way to build multi-platform images.

Continue to the next challenge if you want to learn to use the newer multi-arch image pushing method using Docker Buildx. However, you could clean up the code here because we won't be using this code.
