This challenge can be skipped if you don't plan to share CLI shells with other developers.

An use case is improving ffmpeg as an open source CLI tool to convert videos, then you can share the terminal with other developers to use ffmpeg in their terminal

We will not actually improve the ffmpeg code in this challenge. In lieu of that, we will just install the official ffmpeg. At the next challenge, we will actually bundle in a command line tool of our own coding in lieu of ffmpeg.

Dockerfile:
```
# Use Debian as the base image
FROM debian:bullseye-slim

# Install FFmpeg and its dependencies
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y ffmpeg && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set the working directory in the container.
# All below commands will work from working directory.
WORKDIR /app

# Set the default command to start a shell
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

^ Notice that a Bash terminal is opened

Build the image:
```
docker build -t ffmpeg-shell .
```

Run the virtual container off of the image:
```
docker run -it ffmpeg-shell
```

You are now inside a shell with immediate access to ffmpeg:

Note that you're inside /app in the container. Note that use is limited because your container has no awareness of your host computer's files, so you can't actually use ffmpeg to convert videos in any meaningful way. Mounting was covered in another challenge already, so you could choose to enhance the setup here to be able to convert video files on the host computer. Regardless, you can test that ffmpeg works by running `which ffmpeg` like in the above screenshot.
