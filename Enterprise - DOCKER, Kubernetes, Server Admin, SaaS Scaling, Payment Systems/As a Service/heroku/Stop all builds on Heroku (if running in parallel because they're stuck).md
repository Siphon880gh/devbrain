Turn off all builds on Heroku (if previous builds are stuck)

  

To turn off all builds on Heroku, you can follow these steps:

  

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

  

2. Log in to your Heroku account by running the following command and following the prompts:

  

   ```shell

   heroku login

   ```

  

3. Navigate to your Heroku app's directory. You can use the `cd` command to change directories:

  

   ```shell

   cd /path/to/your/app

   ```

  

4. Run the following command to disable all builds on your Heroku app:

  

   ```shell

   heroku builds:disable

   ```

  

   This command will disable all automatic builds triggered by Heroku's build system.

  

5. Confirm the action by typing `y` or `yes` when prompted.

  

Once you disable the builds, Heroku will no longer automatically trigger new builds when you push changes to your app's repository. However, you can still manually trigger builds if needed. To re-enable automatic builds, you can use the `heroku builds:enable` command.

Note that disabling builds does not affect any existing deployments or the currently running instances of your app. It only stops Heroku from automatically building and deploying new changes.
