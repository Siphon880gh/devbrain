The other networking tutorials are in my folder: Dedicated Server or VPS. Setting up more web server instances within your dedicated server via virtualizations requires you to know how to edit the `/etc/network/interfaces` to add bridges ala "virtual bridges" and assigning static IP address (in that case, assigning IP address to a VM so it can be discovered on the internet as its own web server).

The current folder concerns basics of networking so you're not totally lost when editing network settings to add virtual devices to make your network include VMs.
