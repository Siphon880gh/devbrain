Why important: Usually not important. It's knowledge how computers work

It might be very important: If you install a service and there's an error about kernel modules, then you may need to modify kernel modules and recompile your kernel if you want the service to work. For example, an old Docker 1.7.1 required ip_nat, ip_conntrack, and iptables which was not part of GoDaddy's CentOS 6.1 VPS (Unfortunately in that case, their customer service instructed me I'm not allowed to recompile the kernel)

- The kernel is the core component of an operating system. It acts as a bridge between applications and the actual data processing done at the hardware level. The kernel's responsibilities include managing the system's resources (like the CPU, memory, and disk space) and allowing software and hardware to communicate with each other.
- A kernel module, often referred to simply as a module, is a piece of code that can be loaded into the kernel of an operating system on demand, without necessarily rebooting the system

The `uname` command in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems is used to display system information. Here's what each of the options you asked about does:

1. **`uname -r`**: This command displays the kernel release of the operating system. It provides information about the specific version of the kernel that your system is currently using.
    
2. **`uname -a`**: This option prints all available system information in the following order: kernel name, network node hostname, kernel release, kernel version, machine hardware name, processor type, hardware platform, and operating system. It's a quick way to get a comprehensive overview of the system's configuration and state.
    
3. **`uname -o`**: This command outputs the operating system name. It's useful for scripts or applications that need to know if they're running on Linux, GNU/Linux, or other variations recognized by the system.

For example:
3.10.0-1160.80.1.vz7.191.4

Linux s97-74-232-20.secureserver.net 3.10.0-1160.80.1.vz7.191.4 #1 SMP Thu Dec 15 20:31:06 MSK 2022 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
