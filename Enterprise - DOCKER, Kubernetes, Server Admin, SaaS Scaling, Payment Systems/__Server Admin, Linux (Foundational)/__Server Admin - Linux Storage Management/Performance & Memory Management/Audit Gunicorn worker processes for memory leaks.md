Goal: Determine if your application / api / scripts are having memory leaks. 
Reminder: Gunicorn lets you clone a python script (including flask scripts) into worker processes listening at the same port.

Refer to [[Audit how much memory a process uses]]
You will specifically be filtering in gunicorn processes only, thereby seeing how much memory the gunicorn worker processes use

After the test user finishes using the application / api / script, check memory for the multiple worker processes. They should all relatively be the same memory use. Otherwise, you have a memory leak. This is assuming you're on a server that's not touched by strangers.

Let's say all scripts are done running and not all gunicorn worker processes were used. Then this example show memory leaks:

The behavior you're observing with the Gunicorn worker processes consuming more RAM than expected, even after tasks are completed, could be due to several reasons. Here's a breakdown of potential causes and steps you might take to troubleshoot or resolve the issue:
### Script side:

- **Memory Leaks in Application Code**: If there's a memory leak in your application, it can cause the memory usage to continually increase over time, especially as more requests are processed. Carefully review your code, especially around the parts where you handle photo uploads and video generation. Look for places where memory might not be getting released properly.
- **Inefficient Resource Handling**: Ensure that all file handles, database connections, and other resources are being closed properly after use. Left open, these can consume memory unnecessarily.
- **Profiling and Monitoring**:
	   - **Memory Profilers**: Use tools like `memory_profiler` in Python to track down memory usage in your code.
	   - **Logging**: Enhance logging around photo uploads and video generation to understand better how memory usage correlates with application activity.
	   - **System Monitoring Tools**: Use tools like `htop`, `top`, and `free` to monitor memory usage in real-time and understand how it changes in response to different workloads.
   - **Memory Leak in Application Code**: Your Flask application might have a memory leak. This can happen due to improper handling of large objects or not freeing up resources. Profiling your application for memory usage can help identify such leaks.
   - **Caching by Python**: Python has its own memory management and might hold onto memory for reuse rather than returning it to the operating system immediately. This behavior is more pronounced with large objects like the ones used in video processing.
   - **External Libraries**: If you are using external libraries for image processing or video creation, check if they properly release resources after use. Some libraries might require explicit commands to free up memory.
   - **File Descriptors and Resources**: Ensure that all file descriptors (like open files, sockets) are properly closed after their use. Resources not closed properly can lead to memory not being freed.
   - **Memory Leak in Application Code**: Your Flask application might have a memory leak. This can happen due to improper handling of large objects or not freeing up resources. Profiling your application for memory usage can help identify such leaks.
   - **Caching by Python**: Python has its own memory management and might hold onto memory for reuse rather than returning it to the operating system immediately. This behavior is more pronounced with large objects like the ones used in video processing.
    

### Gunicorn side::

3. **Gunicorn Configuration**:

   - **Worker Class**: By default, Gunicorn uses synchronous workers. If you're handling long-lived connections or expecting a lot of I/O-bound operations, consider using an asynchronous worker class like gevent or eventlet which might handle concurrency and memory management more efficiently.
   - **Max Requests**: Set the `--max-requests` option to a reasonable number to allow workers to be restarted after processing a specified number of requests. This can mitigate the effects of any memory leak or bloat by periodically refreshing the workers.
   - **Debugging Worker Processes**: If you can't pinpoint the issue through profiling and monitoring, you might need to attach a debugger to the worker processes to understand better what's happening at runtime.
   - **Gunicorn Workers**: Gunicorn spawns worker processes to handle requests. These workers might hold onto memory. If a worker handled a large request, it might not release the memory immediately. Restarting the workers periodically can help in such cases.  
   - **Supervisor Configuration**: Check if the Supervisor configuration is set up correctly. Incorrect configurations might prevent proper resource management.

### Trigger Unicorn Worker Process Restart
Flask itself cannot directly trigger Gunicorn to restart because Flask is a web framework that runs within the Gunicorn worker processes, and it doesn't have control over the Gunicorn master process. However, you can indirectly achieve a Gunicorn restart using external methods. Here are a few approaches:

1. **External Script**: You can have an external script that monitors your Flask application for certain conditions and triggers a Gunicorn restart. This script can be a separate process or a cron job.
    
2. **Supervisor Control**: If you are using Supervisor to manage Gunicorn, you can create an endpoint in your Flask application that, when triggered, executes a command to restart the Gunicorn process via Supervisor's command-line interface. Ensure this endpoint is secured to prevent unauthorized access.
    
3. **Gunicorn Configuration**: Configure Gunicorn to automatically restart workers after a certain number of requests (`max-requests`) or if they consume too much memory (`max-requests-jitter`). This is not a direct restart triggered by Flask but can help in managing worker health.
    
4. **Internal Signaling**: Although not a standard practice, it's technically possible for a Flask route to send a signal to the Gunicorn master process to gracefully restart all workers. This requires your Flask app to have the process ID of the Gunicorn master and appropriate permissions to send signals.
    
5. **HTTP Request to Supervisor Web Interface**: If Supervisor's web interface is enabled, you can make an HTTP request from Flask to this interface to trigger a restart. This method also requires proper security measures.
    

For security and stability, it's important to ensure that such restart mechanisms are well-protected and only triggered under controlled conditions. Restarting a web server can lead to temporary downtime and should be managed carefully.
