Hostinger Add FTP
Hostinger VPS Ubuntu 22.04 CloudPanel - Add FTP

At Cloud Panel go to SSH/FTP

The “FTP Users” requires more setting security, firewall, etc.

More easily, just add SSH Users. You can connect via SFTP

The root account for your server also doubles as SFTP (because it's for SSH)

You cannot create an username that's the same as the domain name (it just wont allow you)
