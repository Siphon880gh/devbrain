### Roles:

1. **System Administrator**: A SysAdmin is responsible for the configuration, upkeep, and reliable operation of computer systems, especially multi-user computers, such as servers. They handle SSL certificate installation, renewal, and management, as well as DNS configuration and troubleshooting.

	- Reworded: A System Administrator (SysAdmin) primarily focuses on managing and maintaining IT infrastructure, ensuring stability, and providing user support. They are responsible for configuring, operating, and maintaining servers and informatics systems. SysAdmins typically handle a broad range of tasks, including **LAN management**.

3. **DevOps Engineer**: A DevOps Engineer bridges the gap between software development and IT operations. They often manage server infrastructure, automate SSL certificate deployment, configure DNS, and ensure the availability, performance, and security of applications.
   
	- Reworded: A DevOps Engineer focuses on automating and integrating development and operations processes to improve deployment efficiency and collaboration within teams. Unlike SysAdmins, DevOps Engineers are actively involved in the software development lifecycle, bridging the gap between development and operations, which distinguishes them from traditional system administrators.

5. **Network Administrator** (optional): In some cases, especially where complex DNS setups or network configurations are involved, a Network Administrator might be needed. They specialize in the management of network infrastructure, including DNS.
    
6. **Web Hosting Administrator**: Professionals in this field typically manage tasks related to: Setting up and renewing SSL certificates to ensure secure communication between clients and servers; Configuring A records, CNAMEs, MX records, and other DNS settings to ensure that domain names resolve correctly to web servers; Using Web Hosting Control Panels like WHM (Web Host Manager) and cPanel for managing server resources, websites, databases, email accounts, and more.


### Overlaps and Differences:

1. **System Administrator (SysAdmin) and DevOps Engineer**:

	- **Overlaps**: Both roles involve managing servers, maintaining system stability, and ensuring the smooth operation of IT infrastructure. Tasks like SSL certificate management and DNS configuration are common to both SysAdmins and DevOps Engineers. They both focus on automation, though with different priorities: SysAdmins may use automation to streamline routine tasks, while DevOps Engineers use automation to enhance development and deployment processes.
	
	- **Differences**: The primary distinction lies in their focus. SysAdmins are more oriented towards maintaining the existing infrastructure, ensuring uptime, and supporting users, while DevOps Engineers focus on integrating development and operations, emphasizing automation in the software development lifecycle and CI/CD pipelines. DevOps Engineers are typically more involved in development and deployment processes than SysAdmins.

2. **System Administrator (SysAdmin) and Network Administrator**:

	- **Overlaps**: Both roles may involve managing network components, especially in smaller environments where responsibilities overlap. SysAdmins often handle basic network configurations like setting up DNS and managing IP addresses.
	
	- **Differences**: Network Administrators specialize in managing network infrastructure, such as routers, switches, firewalls, and complex DNS setups. They ensure network performance, security, and connectivity, whereas SysAdmins focus on the broader IT infrastructure, including servers, software, and sometimes basic networking tasks.

3. **DevOps Engineer and Network Administrator**:

	- **Overlaps**: DevOps Engineers sometimes manage infrastructure-related tasks that require a deep understanding of networking, particularly in cloud environments. They might configure networking components within cloud platforms and automate networking tasks as part of deployment processes.
	
	- **Differences**: Network Administrators, however, are specialists in networking, with a focus on optimizing and securing the network layer, while DevOps Engineers apply networking knowledge within the context of development and operations integration.

4. **Web Hosting Administration**:

	- **Overlaps with SysAdmins**: Web Hosting Administrators share tasks with SysAdmins, such as managing servers, configuring DNS, and maintaining SSL certificates. Both roles may use similar tools like WHM and cPanel.
	
	- **Overlaps with DevOps Engineers**: If automation is involved, Web Hosting Administrators might perform tasks typically associated with DevOps, such as automating deployments of web services.
	
	- **Differences**: Web Hosting Administrators are typically more specialized in managing web servers, hosting environments, and related tools, focusing on the specific needs of web hosting rather than the broader IT infrastructure or development lifecycle.

  

### Role Specialization:

Depending on the environment and specific needs, these roles can be specialized. For example:

- In a **Linux-based environment**, the role might be titled "Linux Server Administrator."

- For someone focused on **web servers and hosting**, the title might be "Web Server Administrator" or "Web Hosting Administrator."

- If the job involves **virtualization and cloud services**, titles like "Cloud Infrastructure Engineer" or "Virtualization Engineer" would be more appropriate.
