Status: Untested

While Makefile is known to be cross-platform, available on pretty much all Linux server distros, there are some nuances

It does not take care of platform specific syntaxes like how variables are declared (%VAR% in Windows, $VAR in Unix-like systems)

Or like how unix-like paths use `/` for directories, while Windows use `\`

Adjusting for variables:
```
ifeq ($(OS),Windows_NT)  
    USER_VAR = %USERNAME%  
    PATH_VAR = %PATH%  
else  
    USER_VAR = $$USER  # $$ to escape the single $ in Makefile  
    PATH_VAR = $$PATH  
endif  
  
show-vars:  
    @echo User: $(USER_VAR)  
    @echo Path: $(PATH_VAR)
```

Adjusting for slashes:
```
ifeq ($(OS),Windows_NT)  
    SEP = \  
else  
    SEP = /  
endif  
  
# Example of using the SEP variable in file paths  
my_target:  
    echo "Using the correct path: path$(SEP)to$(SEP)my$(SEP)file"
```
