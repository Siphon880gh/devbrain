### ✅ With `"activeTab"` permission:

After user interaction, you can do this:

```js
chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true }, function(tabs) {
  const tab = tabs[0];
  console.log("Title:", tab.title);
  console.log("URL:", tab.url);
});
```

That works **even without** `"tabs"` in your manifest, **as long as** you have `"activeTab"`.

---

### 🔐 What else does `"activeTab"` do?

It gives your extension **temporary** access to the **currently active tab**, **only after** the user interacts with your extension — like clicking your **popup**, **browser action**, or **context menu**.

Specifically, it lets you:

- Inject scripts (e.g. `chrome.scripting.executeScript`)
- Capture the tab (e.g. for screenshots or content inspection)
- Access certain tab properties (`url`, `title`, etc.)

👉 **Without needing `"tabs"` permission** in your manifest.


---

### ✅ Example use cases:

```js
chrome.action.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
  chrome.scripting.executeScript({
    target: { tabId: tab.id },
    func: () => {
      alert("Hello from extension!");
    },
  });
});
```

This works **with only `"activeTab"` permission**, because the user clicked the extension button — triggering access to that tab.

---

### 🛑 Limitations:

- Only works for the **active** tab the user interacted with.
- Doesn’t let you see or modify **background tabs** or get **tab lists** — you'd need `"tabs"` for that.

### ❗️No background access

If you try to access the title or URL of tabs **without user interaction**, or for **non-active tabs**, it won’t work — unless you have the `"tabs"` permission.



---

### 💡 Why use `"activeTab"` instead of `"tabs"`?

- It’s **more private and secure**.
    
- Users don’t get scared by install warnings like:
    
    > "This extension can read and change all your data on the websites you visit."
    
- Good for extensions that **only interact with a tab after user clicks** — like a screenshot tool, content scraper, or enhancer.
    

---
### Not needed for opening tabs:

You're only using:

```js
chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true }, ...)
```

and

```js
chrome.tabs.update(...)
```

That doesn’t require the `"tabs"` permission if you're:

- Running from the **popup script**, and
- Not accessing restricted tab fields like `url`, `favIconUrl`, etc.

### 🔐 Summary:

|Feature|Needs `"tabs"`?|Works with `"activeTab"`?|
|---|---|---|
|Get active tab's title/url after user clicks|❌|✅|
|Get background tab info (any time)|✅|❌|
|Inject script into active tab|❌|✅|
|Modify/update active tab's URL|❌|✅|

### 🧠 Think of it like:

> “The user just clicked my extension, so I can now temporarily interact with the tab they’re looking at — but only this one tab.”
