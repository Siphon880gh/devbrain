In Chrome extension development, both `popup.js` and `sidebar.js` can save to and access the same localhost, provided they have the necessary permissions. Here's a breakdown of how this can be achieved:

1. **Permissions**: Ensure that your extension's `manifest.json` file has the necessary permissions. If you're making AJAX requests to a localhost server, you might need the `http://localhost/*` permission. (Otherwise it would say undefined reading .local)

```json
{
"permissions": [
"http://localhost/*"
]
}
```

2. **Shared Local Storage**: Both the popup and the sidebar can access the same `chrome.storage.local` or `chrome.storage.sync` to save and retrieve data. This allows them to share data seamlessly.

For example, in `popup.js`:

```javascript
chrome.storage.local.set({key: 'value'}, function() {
console.log('Value is set to ' + value);
});
```

And in `sidebar.js`, you can retrieve the same value:

```javascript
chrome.storage.local.get(['key'], function(result) {
console.log('Value currently is ' + result.key);
});
```

Local vs Sync storage
sync will be between devices if same Chrome profile but can store less data
Local can store more data
Requires extension Storage Area Explorer yo view key value pairs


3. **XHR/AJAX Requests**: Both `popup.js` and `sidebar.js` can make XHR or AJAX requests to the same localhost server. Ensure that your server's CORS settings allow requests from your extension.

For example, in both `popup.js` and `sidebar.js`, you can make a request like:

```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:3000/data')
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

4. **Background Scripts**: If you want to centralize certain operations, you can use a background script. Both `popup.js` and `sidebar.js` can communicate with the background script using `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` and `chrome.runtime.onMessage`.

In summary, both `popup.js` and `sidebar.js` in a Chrome extension can save to and access the same localhost, but you need to ensure the necessary permissions are set and handle CORS issues if you're making requests to a local server.




In the context of Chrome extensions, while you can use the standard web `localStorage` API (i.e., `localStorage.getItem()`, `localStorage.setItem()`, etc.), it's often recommended to use the `chrome.storage` API instead. Here's why:

1. **Persistence Across Different Parts of the Extension**: The `chrome.storage` API allows data to be shared and accessed across different parts of the extension, such as popups, background scripts, content scripts, and options pages. This makes it easier to manage and synchronize data across various components.

2. **Synchronization**: The `chrome.storage.sync` method allows data to be automatically synchronized across multiple devices where the user is logged into Chrome with the same account. This is not possible with the standard `localStorage`.

3. **Quota and Storage Limits**: The `chrome.storage` API provides methods to check the storage quota and the amount of data currently stored, which can be useful for managing data storage efficiently.

4. **Event-Driven Changes**: The `chrome.storage` API provides the `chrome.storage.onChanged` event, which allows you to listen for changes to the storage area and react accordingly. This is not available with the standard `localStorage`.

5. **Security**: The `chrome.storage` API is more secure than `localStorage` because it's isolated to the extension's context. Data stored in `localStorage` can be accessed by any script running on the page, making it vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

That said, if you're only storing data temporarily and don't need the advanced features of `chrome.storage`, you can still use `localStorage`. However, for most Chrome extension use cases, `chrome.storage` is the preferred method due to its advantages.




Chrome Extension's chrome.storage.local:
It's a Chrome Extension API that allows you to store key-value pairs.
The data can be stored in various formats, not just strings.
It has a much larger storage limit (up to the available disk space).
You cannot view its data in the "LocalStorage" section of the developer tools. Instead, if you want to inspect the data stored in chrome.storage.local, you'll need to use the chrome.storage.local.get method and log the results to the console or use an extension like Storage Area Explorer to inspect it.
So, after using chrome.storage.local.set, you won't see the data in the "LocalStorage" section of the developer tools. If you want to verify that the data was saved correctly, you can use chrome.storage.local.get in your extension's code and log the result to the console.



BUT thereâ€™s a difference between local and sync

`chrome.storage.local` and `chrome.storage.sync` are two different storage areas provided by the Chrome Extensions API for storing extension data.

1. **chrome.storage.local**:
   - **Scope**: Data stored here is local to the machine on which it's set. It doesn't get synchronized across the user's Chrome instances on different devices.
   - **Storage Limit**: It has a higher storage limit, typically around 5MB or more, depending on the browser's implementation.
   - **Use Case**: It's suitable for storing large amounts of data that doesn't need to be synced across devices.

2. **chrome.storage.sync**:
   - **Scope**: Data stored in `chrome.storage.sync` will be automatically synchronized to any Chrome browser that the user is logged into, given that the extension is installed on that browser. This allows users to access their extension's data on any device where they use Chrome and are signed in.
   - **Storage Limit**: It has a lower storage limit, typically around 100KB. There are also limits on the number of items and operations per hour.
   - **Use Case**: It's suitable for storing user preferences or other small amounts of data that you want to be available across multiple devices.

In summary, while both `chrome.storage.local` and `chrome.storage.sync` allow you to store data for your extension, the key difference is that `chrome.storage.sync` will synchronize that data across multiple devices where the user has installed the extension and is signed into Chrome. On the other hand, `chrome.storage.local` will only store data locally on the current device.
