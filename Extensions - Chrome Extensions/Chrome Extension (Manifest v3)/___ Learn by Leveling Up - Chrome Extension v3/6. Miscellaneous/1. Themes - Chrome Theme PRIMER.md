## Basics

Aka: Get Started

It's created using manifest.json as well:

```
{
    "manifest_version": 3,
    "name": "My Awesome Theme",
    "version": "1.0",
    "theme": {
      "colors": {
        "frame": [66, 133, 244],
        "toolbar": [51, 103, 214],
        "tab_text": [255, 255, 255],
        "bookmark_text": [255, 255, 255],
        "ntp_background": [255, 255, 255],
        "ntp_text": [0, 0, 0]
      },
      "icons": {
        "16": "icons/icon16.png",
        "32": "icons/icon32.png",
        "48": "icons/icon48.png",
        "128": "icons/icon128.png"
      }
    }
  }
```

^ ntp_ is New Tab Page background and text.

Make sure to create the icon set.

Drag and drop it to chrome://extensions

Please note after installing a theme, Chrome will create a "Cached Theme.pak" file into the  folder that contains the manifest.json and the icon files. This is normal. This file helps Chrome load themes faster without needing to reparse the `manifest.json`. When packaging this for users, you DO NOT include the Cached Theme file because it's auto generated on each user's machine after they install your theme and it contains platform-dependent data.
