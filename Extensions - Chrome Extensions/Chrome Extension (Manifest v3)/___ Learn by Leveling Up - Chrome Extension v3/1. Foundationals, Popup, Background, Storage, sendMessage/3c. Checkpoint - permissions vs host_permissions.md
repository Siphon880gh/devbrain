In Chrome Extension Manifest V3, `host_permissions` and `permissions` both define what your extension is allowed to do — but they apply to **different types of access**:

### 🔐 `permissions`

This is for **general extension API access**, not tied to any particular websites.

Examples:

```json
"permissions": [
  "storage",
  "tabs",
  "scripting",
  "notifications"
]
```

These allow your extension to use privileged Chrome APIs.

### 🌐 `host_permissions`

This is for **access to specific websites/domains** — essentially, URLs your extension can interact with (read/write content via `content_scripts` or `scripting.executeScript()`).

Examples:

```json
"host_permissions": [
  "https://*.example.com/*",
  "*://*.google.com/*"
]
```

This grants your extension access to those pages.

### 🔑 Why separate them?

In Manifest V2, everything was lumped together under `permissions`, which led to **overly broad permissions**. V3 splits them to encourage **least privilege**:

- `permissions`: Core Chrome features
- `host_permissions`: Access to specific sites

Chrome can now also **request host permissions at runtime** (via the **optional permissions** model), which gives users more control.

### 📝 Example

```json
{
  "name": "Example Extension",
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "permissions": [
    "storage",
    "tabs"
  ],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://*.example.com/*",
    "https://*.another-site.com/*"
  ]
}
```

This extension:
- Can use Chrome’s `storage` and `tabs` APIs.
- Can read/modify content on `example.com` and `another-site.com`.
