At manifest.json, we add "alarms". So your permissions at this point may look like:
```
"permissions": ["scripting", "activeTab", "alarms", "storage"],
```

Alarms is used in place of setTimeout in background.js in v3 because background is not working as a service worker. Alarms run **outside** the JavaScript thread of your service worker and wakes up the service worker when the alarm triggers, **even if it was sleeping**. This is to prevent more unpredictable errors as a result of v3's replacement of background with service worker.
