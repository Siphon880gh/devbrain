Manifest.json's "content_scripts" section lets you add zero or more content js and zero or more content css which Chrome looks for in order to know what logic to affect the webpage and what styles to apply. The "content_scripts" section matches against URLs to know when to apply as soon as the webpage is finished loading (if you've set the lifecycle at "content_scripts" to the end). You can choose to skip the css by not including a css property at "content_scripts". Most often the use is for javascript.

Key takeaway:
- No need to click the Chrome Extension icon to run.
- Running starts as soon as it detects a webpage matches one of the URLs you define at manifest.json, as long as the Chrome Extension is installed and enabled.
- The code are located in content.js and you can have dependencies like jquery by having additional js files you load into content_scripts. Libraries must be local (CDN not allowed in manifest v3). Have the dependencies listed first at "content_scripts".js.

## Concept

- We are learning content (reading from / writing to webpage), but note there are other types of presentation in Chrome Extension like popup, devtools panel, devtools sidebar covered in other tutorials.  
	- content or content js is the logic of reading from or writing to the webpage that's on the web browser. The manifest.json will have matching url pattern so it doesn't run on just any webpage you visit. Content code does not need the user to click the chrome extension to run - it will run automatically. Proof: If you have many chrome extensions that are enabled, visit a webpage and inspect, and you'll likely see chrome extension related code in the HTML. The manifest.json also points to your file that has the content logic (by convention, content.js)
	- In manifest.js, you configure content using "content_scripts" section. Even though it's called scripts, it can also inject css files.
	- A content script does not have direct access to JavaScript variables or functions defined on the page but can modify the DOM

## Namesake
- content.js or content_scripts is for the web content at the active a bar. this is why it’s called content, because we are looking at web content. The executeScript is for web content only, probably because the first chrome extensions were content centric, so naming a function the generic “execute script” would refer to the web content.

### Files

Setup the files from [[2a. Chrome extension foundational with popup]] with some variation (refer below).

Create manifest.json among other files including content.js to modify/read from any visited website that matched a url pattern (no need to click Chrome Extension)

### manifest.json

#### manifest.json Overview

manifest.json for content js (for reading/modifying from webpage):

manifest.json for a popup (for learning foundations):
- Manifest version 3.
- Include your app name, version and description (affects Chrome extension store) and icons to show on the web browser pinned extensions area, the Google chrome extension store, etc.
- Includes Content Security Policy rules which is permission and scoping.
- We added a content script section for the content reading/modifying. We'll go more into details at a later section, but briefly it matches domains to apply the injections to, and it points to content js file to inject and optionally a content css file to inject (to change appearance of the webpage), and finally a lifecycle to inject at (eg. document_idle, document_start, etc)

manifest.json:
```
{  
    "manifest_version": 3,  
    "name": "<APP_NAME>",  
    "version": "1.0",  
    "description": "<APP_DESCRIPTION>.",  
    "author": "Weng Fei Fung",
    "icons": {  
        "16": "icon16x16.png",  
        "32": "icon32x32.png",  
        "48": "icon48x48.png",  
        "128": "icon128x128.png"  
    },
    "content_security_policy": {  
        "extension_pages": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; object-src 'self';"
    },
    "content_scripts": [
        {
	        "matches": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*"],
	        "js": ["content.js"],
	        "css": ["content.css"],
	        "run_at": "document_end"
        }
    ]
}
```
#### manifest.json CSP (content security policy)

You should know it by now. If you need to, review [[2b. Content Security Policy - script, style, object, img, connect, default - Foundational]].

#### manifest.json Icons

You should know how to generate or create icons by now. If you need to, review [[2b. Content Security Policy - script, style, object, img, connect, default - Foundational]]. 

If you dont have icons, the installation will fail with the error:

#### manifest.json content_scripts

Content scripts
- JS or CSS:
	- You can inject js and/or css files to a url (can be wildcard matched).
- Multiple js or multiple css: 
	- You're not forced to have only one js file or only one css file. If it helps to keep organized, you could have multiple js or css files named with their purposes.
	- Dependencies? Please note you cannot simply link to a cdn for js files (eg. jquery) because Google has gotten strict with manifest v3. You'll have to provide your own jquery file in your extension folder. You'd load multiple js files into the content_scripts. Have the dependencies listed first before your own scripts at "content_scripts".js.
- Multiple domains: 
	- You can match multiple domains to the same set of js and css files.
	- You can match different domains to different sets of js and css files.
##### matches

This defines **which URLs** your content script will run on. It's an array of [match patterns](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/match_patterns/), which are strings that specify URLs.

**Example values:**

- `"https://*/*"` → all HTTPS pages
- `"http://*/*"` → all HTTP pages
- `"*://*.example.com/*"` → all pages on example.com (including subdomains)
- `"*://mail.google.com/*"` → only Gmail pages
- `"*://*/*"` → all pages on any protocol (risky! use carefully)

✅ **Must include protocol** (http or https)  
❌ Cannot use wildcards in the domain _path_ (e.g., `*example.com` is invalid — use `*.example.com`)

##### Injections

- `"js"`: JavaScript file(s) to inject.
- `"css"`: CSS file(s) to inject.

Example with multiples:
```
{
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://*.example.com/*"],
      "js": ["lib/jquery.js", "helpers.js", "main.js"],
      "css": ["reset.css", "styles.css"],
      "run_at": "document_end"
    }
  ]
}
```

Examples with singulars:
```
{
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://*.example.com/*"],
      "js": "content.js",
      "css": "content.css",
      "run_at": "document_end"
    }
  ]
}

```

##### run_at

This controls **when** your content script is injected into the page:

| Value              | When It Runs                                                       | Notes                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `"document_start"` | Before the page starts loading (early as possible)                 | Useful for blocking/pre-loading           |
| `"document_end"`   | After the HTML is loaded, but before other resources (like images) | Safe for DOM manipulation                 |
| `"document_idle"`  | After the page is fully loaded (default)                           | Best for waiting until everything’s ready |

If you don’t set `run_at`, Chrome uses `"document_idle"` by default.


Example:
- This injects `content.js` into all HTTPS pages on `example.com` **before the page starts loading**.
```json
{
  "matches": ["https://*.example.com/*"],
  "js": ["content.js"],
  "run_at": "document_start"
}
```

Setup content.js as:
```
console.log("Content script loaded");

  // Check if the current URL contains google.com
if (window.location.href.includes('google.com')) {
    // Show alert if Google is found
    alert('Found Google');
} 
```

Remove css property for content_scripts if still have, from manifest.

## Create content.css

Create content.css:
```
body {
    background-color: red !important;
}
```

---

## Test

Install Chrome Extension and visit google.com. It should alert "Found Google".

Visiting google.com directly, THEN you'd get this message upon it finished loading:
![[Pasted image 20250322175353.png]]

Note there's a glitch with Chrome where if you have default settings and it's a new tab that has google opened, it won't work because technically it's not google.com, it's just Google Chrome's default tab. Note the address bar is empty after pressing CMD+N to open a new tab and the new tab automatically goes to google.com (if on default settings):
