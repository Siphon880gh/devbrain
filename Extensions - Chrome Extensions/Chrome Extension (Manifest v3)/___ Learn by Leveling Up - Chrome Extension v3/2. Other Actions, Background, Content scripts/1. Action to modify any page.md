Recall that there are popup actions where clicking a chrome extension opens an overlaying popup. And there are popup functions that clicking the chrome extension will run a javascript function.

We will use a function action so that clicking a chrome extension can modify the current active tab's page. For simplicity we will have it change the background color of the page.

Key takeaway:
- By not defining a "default_popup" in manifest.json's action, you change it to a function action.
- The function action expects background.js to listen for an onclick event from the Chrome's Action API (`chrome.action.onClicked.addListener`).
- User must click the Chrome Extension to run.

### Files

Setup the files from [[2a. Chrome extension foundational with popup]] with some variation (refer below).

Create manifest.json among other files including background.js to modify/read from the current webpage on the web browser.

### manifest.json

#### manifest.json Overview

manifest.json for content js (for reading/modifying from webpage):

manifest.json for a popup (for learning foundations):
- Manifest version 3.
- Include your app name, version and description (affects Chrome extension store) and icons to show on the web browser pinned extensions area, the Google chrome extension store, etc.
- Includes Content Security Policy rules which is permission and scoping.
- We are changing the `"action":` section from a popup action into a function action by removing `default_popup` property
- But for that function to be triggered, it has to be available 24/7 when the extension's been installed, so we need a background.js, in which case is a service worker because v3 has changed background mechanism to a service worker mechanism. We added a background section to manifest.

manifest.json:
```
{  
    "manifest_version": 3,  
    "name": "<APP_NAME>",  
    "version": "1.0",  
    "description": "<APP_DESCRIPTION>.",  
    "author": "Weng Fei Fung",
    "icons": {  
        "16": "icon16x16.png",  
        "32": "icon32x32.png",  
        "48": "icon48x48.png",  
        "128": "icon128x128.png"  
    },
    "content_security_policy": {  
        "extension_pages": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; object-src 'self';"
    },
    "action": {  
        "default_icon": "icon.png"
    },
    "background": {
	    "service_worker": "background.js"
    },
    "permissions": [
        "scripting"
    ],
    "host_permissions": [
        "https://*/*",
        "http://*/*"
    ]
}
```

#### manifest.json Icons

You should know how to generate or create icons by now. If you need to, review [[2b. Content Security Policy - script, style, object, img, connect, default - Foundational]]. 

If you dont have icons, the installation will fail with the error:
![[Pasted image 20250319004613.png]]
#### manifest.json Permissions and Host Permissions

permissions to allow in Chrome's Scripting API which we need for background.js to run code that affects the active tab's HTML

hosting_permissions broadly permissible to allow google.com. Otherwise it will error that the extension is blocked from affecting that webpage. You can choose to make `host_permissions` more specific to google.

#### manifest.json Function Action and Background

manifest.json → action: 
Review: We made sure there's no popup.html this time at manifest.json:

```
    "action": {  
        "default_icon": "icon.png",
    },
```

We will listen for chrome extension onclick at background.js. That's why manifest.json contains:
```
    "background": {
	    "service_worker": "background.js"
    },
```

If you had a "default_popup" entry at the "action" section, then the Chrome Extension icon's onclick event event won't fire and background.js won't be able to catch it and run your code (hence converting the action into a popup action instead of a function action).

## Background.js

Add to background.js:
```
console.log("Background script loaded");

// Listen for when the extension icon is clicked
chrome.action.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
    console.log('Extension icon was clicked');

    // Get the active tab and change background to green
    chrome.tabs.query({active: true, currentWindow: true}, function(tabs) {
        if (tabs[0]) {
            chrome.scripting.executeScript({
                target: {tabId: tabs[0].id},
                func: () => {
                    document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'green';
                }
            });
        }
    });
});
```

## Test

Install Chrome Extension and visit google.com, AND THEN click the chrome extension. It should change Google page's background color:
![[Pasted image 20250323160157.png]]

Note there's a glitch with Chrome where if you have default settings and it's a new tab that has google opened, it won't work because technically it's not google.com, it's just Google Chrome's default tab. Note the address bar is empty after pressing CMD+N to open a new tab and the new tab automatically goes to google.com (if on default settings):
