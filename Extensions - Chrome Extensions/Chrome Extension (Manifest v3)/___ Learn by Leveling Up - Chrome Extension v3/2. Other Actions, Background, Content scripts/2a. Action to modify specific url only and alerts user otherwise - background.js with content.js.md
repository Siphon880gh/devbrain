## Setup

Let's continue from the same code as [[1. Action to modify any page]]

Modify background.js to:
- Surrounded the main code with if branch where google.com is in the url:
```
console.log("Background script loaded");

// Listen for when the extension icon is clicked
chrome.action.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
    console.log('Extension icon was clicked');

    if (tab.url.includes('google.com')) {
        
        // Get the active tab and change background to green
        chrome.tabs.query({active: true, currentWindow: true}, function(tabs) {
            if (tabs[0]) {
                chrome.scripting.executeScript({
                    target: {tabId: tabs[0].id},
                    func: () => {
                        document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
                    }
                });
            }
        });
    }
});
```

Update Chrome extension and test it. You should find that:
- Clicking chrome extension icon at google.com will cause the background to change green
- Clicking chrome extension icon at any other website (eg. Duckduckgo.com) will do nothing, which can be confusing to users

What if you added an alert that the extension fails because the user is not on google?
If you had added this to background.js you would be wrong:
- **Wrong code!** The code at `alert('This extension only works on Google')` is erroneous but this is to prove a point.
```
console.log("Background script loaded");

// Listen for when the extension icon is clicked
chrome.action.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
    console.log('Extension icon was clicked');

    if (tab.url.includes('google.com')) {
        
        // Get the active tab and change background to green
        chrome.tabs.query({active: true, currentWindow: true}, function(tabs) {
            if (tabs[0]) {
                chrome.scripting.executeScript({
                    target: {tabId: tabs[0].id},
                    func: () => {
                        document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
                    }
                });
            }
        });
    } else {
        alert('This extension only works on Google');
    }
});
```

Background.js **does not** support `alert(..)` because it's thought of as a background process than a frontend script.

Nothing will happen when you click the chrome extension icon on a non-google website. But there are errors logged at the Extensions error page:
- You'd visit chrome://extensions, then click "Errors" button at the chrome extension's card

## Approaches

There are two correct approaches:
- Using Notifications API, you can create a badge or alert on the user's computer. Background.js supports Notifications API, as you've learned at [[5. Simplify background.js - Background actions, Notifications system]]. However, the downside is that some users have notifications turned off intentionally or unintentionally, so they may miss the message.
- You can combine background.js with content.js. Think of content.js as all frontend manipulations. It can change a webpage's content on your web browser, and it **can certainly run alert**. The `content.js` can whitelist only specific url's to work. In our case because the alert is for websites that are everything but google.com, we'll have `content.js` whitelist all possible domains (by wildcarding like `"matches": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*"]`). Then the background.js sends a message of "NOT_GOOGLE", and the content.js listening for messages hears a "NOT_GOOGLE" and so acts accordingly by running alert.

## Approach: Background sends message to Content, then Content alerts

You should be able to implement Notifications by now. You can choose to try that approach yourself.

But for our tutorial, let's go over the second approach of leveraging both background.js with content.js to show an alert message when the user clicks the chrome extension icon (performing the function action) but is not on google.com

Adjust manifest.json:
- Added "content_scripts" to manifest.json
```
{  
    "manifest_version": 3,  
    "name": "<APP_NAME>",  
    "version": "1.0",  
    "description": "<APP_DESCRIPTION>.",  
    "author": "Weng Fei Fung",
    "icons": {  
        "16": "icon16x16.png",  
        "32": "icon32x32.png",  
        "48": "icon48x48.png",  
        "128": "icon128x128.png"  
    },
    "content_security_policy": {  
        "extension_pages": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; object-src 'self';"
    },
    "action": {  
        "default_icon": "icon.png"
    },
    "background": {
	    "service_worker": "background.js"
    },
    "permissions": [
        "scripting", "tabs", "activeTab"
    ],
    "host_permissions": [
        "https://*/*",
        "http://*/*"
    ],
    "content_scripts": [
        {
            "matches": ["https://*/*", "http://*/*"],
            "js": ["content.js"],
            "run_at": "document_end"
        }
    ]
}
```

Adjust background.js:
- Note when it's ran (because user clicks the Chrome Extension), and if the website is not google.com, then the else branch runs
- The else branch sends a message "NOT_GOOGLE" to all of the Chrome Extension's parts
```
console.log("Background script loaded");

// Listen for when the extension icon is clicked
chrome.action.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
    console.log('Extension icon was clicked');

    if (tab.url.includes('google.com')) {
        
        // Get the active tab and change background to green
        chrome.tabs.query({active: true, currentWindow: true}, function(tabs) {
            if (tabs[0]) {
                chrome.scripting.executeScript({
                    target: {tabId: tabs[0].id},
                    func: () => {
                        document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
                    }
                });
            }
        });
    } else {
        // Send a message to the content script in the active tab
        chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true }, function(tabs) {
            chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tabs[0].id, { type: "NOT_GOOGLE" });
        });
  
    }
});
```

Add content.js:
```
console.log("Content script loaded");

chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((request, sender, sendResponse) => {
    if (request.type === 'NOT_GOOGLE') {
        alert('This extension only works on Google');
    }
});
```

## Test

Install/update Chrome Extension and visit google.com, AND THEN click the chrome extension. It should change Google page's background color:

![[Pasted image 20250323175230.png]]

Note there's a glitch with Chrome where if you have default settings and it's a new tab that has google opened, it won't work because technically it's not google.com, it's just Google Chrome's default tab. Note the address bar is empty after pressing CMD+N or CMD+T to open a new tab and the new tab automatically goes to google.com (if on default settings):
![[Pasted image 20250322175233.png]]

Now visit https://duckduckgo.com, AND THEN click the chrome extension. It should alert that the Chrome Extension doesn't support the site:
