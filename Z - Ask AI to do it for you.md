These notes include practical steps for implementing new technologies like Helmet, often including commands like `npm install`.

To get the most out of them, paste the note's instructions into your favorite AI IDE (such as Cursor AI) and use a prompt like this:

```
Let's implement this technology. Make sure the version is compatible with my app. Here are the steps I believe are required:

"""
[Paste the notes here]
"""
```

This helps the AI understand your intent and double-check or refine the steps for your specific setup.

There's a chance that a technology here is outdated, meaning:
- That its latest version is not compatible with your stack
- Or it can't even install because the dependencies are connecting to broken links at the package manager
- Or the latest version has known vulnerabilities that were never patched

In that case, mention the technology in your AI IDE, and ask for a more modern technology:
```
I liked the __TECH__ but it's an old approach. Suggest and implement a more modern approach.
