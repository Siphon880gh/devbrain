**PROMPT**:
You have domain expertise in user experience on web apps and websites.

Review the video on this webpage and recommend the best user experience for video controls based on the page’s content and purpose. Consider whether the video should:

- Remain as-is: clean, auto-playing background video with no controls
- Include full controls: pause/play and volume adjustment
- Include subtle controls: minimal controls that appear on hover
    
Analyze the content and user context, then suggest the most appropriate option. I’ll confirm the direction after your recommendation.
