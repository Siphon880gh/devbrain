**PROMPT**:
The hero section of the front page currently features a video, but the video is cut off at the bottom, breaking visual balance. Typically, hero sections with video use a two-column layout: text on the left, video on the right.

Please redesign the hero slide so that the video aligns horizontally with the text content, using a clean and responsive two-column layout. Ensure the entire video is visible and proportionally balanced with the text, especially on desktop viewports.
