Need help with UX design. Please draw decision tree for a user deciding how to respond to preliminary questionnaire for the ..., then the style of video.... This is a website service.

<<
Now include UX of recording their voice and then being able to modify what was recorded because it was speech to text into a textarea. User submits when ready. Then we charge them. Then provide the slideshow video file or share link. The video creation is automated under the hood.

<<
For the other choices. For AI generated voice from loved one, add to UX Decision Tree about batch uploading many audio clips then selecting submit when ready.

For pre-selected voice, user can choose from a dozen voices first previewing them before selecting a voice and clicking Ready button. Maybe there are options on tones such as somber or optimistic. 

They both lead to voice recording with speech to text or only typing. When voice recording they should be informed their voice will not be the final narrator

<<
Change "Upload for AI Voice" to "Upload Voice of Loved One". 

Change "Informed Voice Not Final" to "Your voice will not be narrator." Then add another condition on the same arrow: "You are inputting with speech to text out of convenience"
