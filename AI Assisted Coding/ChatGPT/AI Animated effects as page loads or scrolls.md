Animated effects as a page loads or as users scroll can completely change how a site feels. Instead of a static wall of content, elements appear with motion—logos ease into view, titles build anticipation with staggered text, and grids or images reveal themselves in waves. These subtle touches guide attention, create hierarchy, and make an experience more memorable without overwhelming the user.

Modern tools like **CSS keyframes**, **JavaScript triggers**, and upgrades like **GSAP timelines** make it straightforward to choreograph these entrance effects. And with Cursor AI, you can plan the animation sequence in natural language, receive a clear to-do checklist, and choose from inline suggestions to refine the look and feel. The result: a page that not only works but comes alive as the visitor interacts with it.

## 1. Define the Animation Sequence

- **Step 1:** Weng logo appears (fade/zoom in).
    
- **Step 2:** Title text (“Spreadsheet Scavenger by Weng”) animates in with staggered words.
    
- **Step 3:** Spreadsheet grid animates prominently, with cells appearing in a wave.
    
- **Step 4:** Inventory and log sections fade or slide in.

## 2. Using Cursor AI for Animation Planning

When you describe the desired animation in Cursor’s chat, it will often:

- Confirm your intent in prose (“I’ll create a beautiful animated entrance sequence…”).
    
- Generate a **to-do checklist** (like in your screenshot), e.g.:
    
    - Create entrance animation for Weng logo
        
    - Add staggered animation for “Spreadsheet Scavenger by Weng” text
        
    - Create prominent animation for spreadsheet grid with cells appearing
        
    - Animate in the inventory and log sections
        
    - Add CSS keyframes and animation timing
        

This to-do list acts as both a **plan** and an **execution guide**.

## 3. How Cursor AI Suggests Inline Options

While editing your files, Cursor AI may present multiple choices in dropdowns or inline completions, for example:

- **In CSS:**
    
    - “Add `@keyframes bounce`”
        
    - “Add hover effect with scale”
        
    - “Add reduced-motion support”
        
- **In JavaScript:**
    
    - “Use IntersectionObserver to trigger grid animation”
        
    - “Stagger title words with delays”
        
    - “Build grid dynamically with diagonal wave reveal”
        

You can cycle through them with arrow keys and accept one with **Tab**.

## 4. Prompt Recipes to Guide Cursor AI

Try these prompts to generate clean staged animations:

- **Entrance flow:**
    
    > “Create a staged entrance animation: logo first, then staggered title text, then a prominent spreadsheet grid reveal, then inventory and log. Provide a checklist and apply the animations in CSS + JS.”
    
- **Accessibility focus:**
    
    > “Implement these animations with respect for `prefers-reduced-motion`, so users with reduced motion settings get static content.”
    
- **Mobile-first:**
    
    > “Make the design mobile responsive: grid adjusts for smaller screens, animations scale gracefully.”

## 5. Optional: GSAP Upgrade

If you need more precise timeline control, smoother easing, or complex sequences, you can ask Cursor AI:

> “Upgrade the animation system to use GSAP timelines instead of plain CSS/JS. Keep the same sequence but use GSAP for timing and stagger control.”

Cursor may respond with a revised to-do list and code diff that swaps transitions for GSAP timeline animations.

## 6. Testing Checklist

- ✅ Animations run once, no infinite loops
- ✅ Text remains readable during motion
- ✅ Works on mobile and desktop layouts
- ✅ Accessible: supports `prefers-reduced-motion`
- ✅ Spreadsheet grid is visually prominent
