As of January 2025, apps built and run inside Google AI Studio can use generative tokens at no cost, including both code generation that creates the app, and text-to-image generation through the app you created.

That said, there are still a few gotchas when relying on Google AI Studio for code generation:

Google AI Studio on random generations will have a bias doing exactly what your SYSTEM OVERRIDES said NOT to do, and out of those random generations, it might choose to ignore your SYSTEM OVERRIDES regardless if they're in the prompt or in Google AI Studio's preferences. This causes the code generation to lose a lot of lines of code or break your app. Sometimes Google AI Studio is biased towards eager to complete (doesn't ask permission), completing other features it thinks your app needs, simplifying the UI (at the expensive of breaking or removing full features). It's recommended you supervise the thinking explanation and stop generation as soon as it steers away from your prompt's purpose. It would cancel any code modifications/generations and restore your code before the prompt was run (if it had started editing code). If the code generation has completed already, to restore to the previous code, see if there's a checkpoint created in the chat - and if not, you will have to restore your code manually by uploading a zip file of the last commit (Google AI Studio can sync with GitHub, so you can download the codebase as a ZIP - and ideally, you’ve been keeping GitHub updated after every prompt-based code change), and then you'd have to drag files back into place. Most times you cannot reverse the changes by prompting it to reverse the changes, because Google AI Studio cannot read its own thoughts from the previous turn, although you can read the thoughts.
