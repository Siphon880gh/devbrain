If you share your Google AI Studio with a friend, they can see your changes, and you can see their changes. 

If you make a change or your friend’s first time opening, your friend will see a message warning it’s developed by another user:

If the friend changed the code and saved or had regenerated any code with a prompt, YOU will see the same message warning it’s developed by another user, even if you technically own the project and you’re visiting at the same URL

There is no way to revert the changes.

Yes you own the project because according to Google AI Studio project in Google Drive, you have the project file (See Aura):

Meanwhile, your friend invited to Aura will only see the prompt files - and no Aura project file:

When they’re invited, they will oddly see an invite to Google Drive, which is oddly still the user experience as of Jan 2026

If it’s your friend’s first time using Google AI Studio, you should let them know there’s no need to open the Google Drive folder. That is pointless. Just visit [https://aistudio.google.com/apps](https://aistudio.google.com/apps) (Or visit Google AI Studio → Yours apps). This is where they can access the project easily:

What you the owner see at Your apps is this:

Notice the difference is the label pill “Created by others”

You can simulate this for yourself

Make sure your computer is in Light mode.

Open regular chrome with one google account. Notice Chrome look white.
Open incognito chrome with another account. Notice the incognito chrome looks dark.

To make things easier, you can have the regular chrome using light mode so it looks like this:
![[Pasted image 20260120235321.png]]

The incognito chrome would in contrast looks dark:
![[Pasted image 20260120235336.png]]

On regular chrome / YOU account, create an app with this prompt:
```
Coming soon page with one section. Background is purple.
```

For example:
![[Pasted image 20260120235435.png]]

Then share it with your “FRIEND” account
![[Pasted image 20260120235506.png]]
->
![[Pasted image 20260120235522.png]]

Then switch over to Incognito Chrome. At your “FRIEND” account, your gmail would’ve received a Google folder invite. Dont need to open it (pointless):
![[Pasted image 20260120235553.png]]

Instead while in Incognito Chrome, you should be able to access the project by visiting Google AI Studio and opening the new app:
![[Pasted image 20260120235616.png]]

Working as the “FRIEND”, change the background from purple to black:
![[Pasted image 20260120235641.png]]

^ The prompt could be:
```
Change background to solid black. No gradient background.
```

Switch back to regular Chrome. You should see the same warning that the app’s been changed by another user:
![[Pasted image 20260120235731.png]]

^ Notice this is the regular Chrome. You also get the warning.

This proves that your friend can see your changes, and you can see their changes. And you know something’s been changed when you get the warning that this is developed by another user, regardless who changed it.
