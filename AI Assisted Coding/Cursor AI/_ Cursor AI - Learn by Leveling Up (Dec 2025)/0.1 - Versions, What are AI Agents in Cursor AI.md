This Level Up series is written for **Cursor v2.2.14 (December 10, 2025)**. We include a snapshot date because Cursor’s features and UI change frequently, and these notes may be updated by the time you read them.

For now, our “leveling up” approach is **reading and understanding the material**, not doing hands-on exercises. In a future update, I’ll add a full walkthrough and a practical challenge.
