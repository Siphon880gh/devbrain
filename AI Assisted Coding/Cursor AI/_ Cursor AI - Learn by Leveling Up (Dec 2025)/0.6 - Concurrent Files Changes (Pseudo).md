Another feature of cursor ai agent is parallel prompts running at their own branches or working trees. Then they merge at the end. The idea is the base infrastructure is done and the parallel bots are working at different features that likely won’t clash. You want to emphasis separation of concerns and MVC

This is pseudo having multiple ai agents working in tandem. There is no true awareness of other AI agents in cursor as of Dec 2025.

Since it’s just taking advantage of git branches being merged at the end, when using Working Tree mode for multiple AI Agents, make sure each agent (aka prompt) is working on a different feature that likely will affect different files. This is more possible if the base code is built with a good infrastructure like a MVC, other than it being a long javascript file with thousands of lines of code.
