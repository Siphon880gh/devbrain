In Cursor, the regular editor chat and the Agent Editor are basically using the **same thing**: prompts as agents.

Any prompt you create in the normal editor’s chat panel will show up as an “agent” when you switch to the Agent Editor. In other words, **the agent _is_ the prompt**.

Functionally, there’s almost no difference.  
Because prompts in Cursor can already access your terminal and files, they’re effectively AI agents. And it can access your GitHub repo (for pulls, pushes, commits, etc.) because Github commands are part of its toolset. 

Regardless you’re using them from the normal editor chat or from the Agent Editor—their intelligence behave the same.

In the Agent Editor, you’ll notice that an agent’s name is just taken from the beginning of its prompt. You currently **can’t** give agents independent “internal” names and then reference those agents by name inside other prompts/agents. Nor can you select from a dropdown what a prompt or AI Agent is good at (a summary AI agent, a QA agent, etc). That is, as of Dec 2025.

Therefore, the rest of this level up series will just get you comfortable thinking with the Agent editor (although you could do the same with the regular editor's chat panel). But we will also bring in the style of prompting that's usually for AI agents, without referencing other AI agents that work simultaneously (Since Cursor Agents are not aware of each other).

In summary: When you click New Agent, it’s actually a new prompt. There no traditional sense of agents in ai web apps like a summary agent or a QA agent, and there’s no identity in the sense of Agent 2 wait for Agent 1 to finish or to output something

AI Agent interface:

Clicking "New Agent" opens another chat interface without the horizontal tabs at the top:

But if you don't open an Agent panel, regular chat interface has the same "Agents" as prompts at the tabs area:

A benefit of the AI Agents panel is you can see which prompts are still running (and you can see if concurrent prompt are running):
