You can run two AI prompts simultaneously in the normal editor’s chat interface just like you can run multiple AI Agents in the Agent Editor. The benefit of using the Agent Editor is visibility: you can instantly see which agents/prompts are still running, all in one place, because each active agent shows a spinning loader.

To illustrate how this works:

- **Agent 1** creates files and eventually generates `script.js`.
    
- **Agent 2** is supposed to minify `script.js` once it exists.  
    Normally, you’d simulate this by giving Agent 2 access to the terminal and telling it to use a simple `while` loop to check whether `script.js` exists before doing its work.
    

But here’s the caveat:

- **Edits are applied incrementally**, not in one final dump.  
    That means `script.js` might appear early while Agent 1 is _still editing it_. Agent 2 could swoop in too soon and minify a file that’s still mid-construction.
    

Even so, using multiple prompts/agents still gives you useful checkpoints. You can trace errors back to specific prompts, you can see which ones are actively running in the Agent Editor, and you can queue all your planned prompts at once instead of manually waiting for each step.

### **Workaround for the incremental-edit limitation**

A practical workaround is to add a **“stability signal”** before Agent 2 begins. Instead of merely checking whether `script.js` exists, have Agent 2 check for _file inactivity_ or a _completion marker_ created by Agent 1. Examples:

- **Timestamp check:** Agent 2 waits until `script.js` hasn’t been modified for X seconds.
    
- **Checksum check:** Agent 2 repeatedly hashes the file and only proceeds when the hash stops changing.
    
- **Done-flag file:** Instruct Agent 1 to create a lightweight `script.ready` (or similar) once all edits to `script.js` are complete. This also means that Agent 2 will need to remove the `script.ready` file.
    
- **Embedded footer marker:** Agent 1 appends a recognizable final comment like `// BUILD_COMPLETE` when it’s truly finished.
    

This gives Agent 2 a reliable condition to start its work—even though Cursor applies edits incrementally—without the two agents stepping on each other.

Now you can see that the fact that Cursor AI's agents are not truly AI agents that can orchestrate with each other (having names, being able to check the status of other AI prompts), you end up simulating it with more complex prompts. This is true as of Dec 2025; I suspect Cursor AI will continue to develop towards true orchestration ability.

However you can automate this by having prompt files in a folder and then have each agent...
