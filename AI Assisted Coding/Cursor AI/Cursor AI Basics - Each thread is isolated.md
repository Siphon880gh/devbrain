**Q:** Does cursor AI refer to previous chat threads even though in a new chat thread?

**A:** Cursor AI treats each chat window as its own session—by default it won’t pull in messages or context from past conversations when you start a new thread. Each thread’s memory is isolated unless you explicitly load or reference earlier snippets.
