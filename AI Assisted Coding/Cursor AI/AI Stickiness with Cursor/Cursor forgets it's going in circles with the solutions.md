Situation: It keeps suggesting approaches that failed, and eventually cycles back to an old failed solution.

**Prompt** the AI to remember its failed approaches. Subsequent prompts:

1. Still same problem. can you give me a short summary of what we attempted and failed so far  
2. Lets fix the problem. Try a new approach. Our previous approaches that failed were: {Copy the previous failed approaches}

An alternative prompt is:
- Look into the previous conversations. You'll see we're alternating between two solutions

Another alternative prompt is, in order to shortcircuit the AI going in circles:
- Do it the proper way
- Or: Do it the more updated way
- Or: Do it the best practice way
