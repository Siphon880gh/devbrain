GOAL:
Create your website for High Conversion, SEO, and Brand Alignment.

If you have a few basic business requirements, this series of prompts will help you generate a **high-converting** and **aesthetic** website using AI.

We follow a **three-phase process**:
1. **Copywriting & Layout Focus**  
    Start by generating the site’s copy and layout structure (placement of sections, content flow, etc.) without overwhelming the AI with full code. This ensures clarity and strong messaging first.
2. **Code Generation Based on Structure**  
    Next, ask the AI to produce clean code using the pseudo-structure from Step 1.
3. **Design Refinement for Branding**  
    Finally, prompt the AI to adjust the design and styling to align with your specific brand and business goals.

💡 **Note:**  
The prompt you’ll paste into ChatGPT or Cursor AI is located in the **Prompt** subsection. You might see a version label there — you can ignore it; it’s just Weng’s way of tracking different versions as he refines the prompt. The prompt may look like a full article and include Markdown formatting — that’s intentional. **Paste the entire Prompt exactly as it appears** (Markdown and all that) into ChatGPT or Cursor AI depending on the instructions.

The **Development** subsection is where Weng explores and drafts ideas for how the prompt should be written. **Do not paste** anything from this section into ChatGPT or Cursor AI.

📖 **How to use:**

## 1- Plain ugly high conversion layout and content planner:

AI generates copywrite layout XML's from business needs. AI will ask the user clarifying questions to understand their business needs and goals.

> [!note] Development - Original Prompt
>
> Propose a structured syntax or lightweight XML/JSON format that copywriters can use to communicate website content and layout intent to AI models or developers. The format should support defining high-converting page sections (e.g., headlines, hero images, CTAs, testimonials, product features) and help bridge the gap between copywriting and design implementation for web pages optimized for conversion.

>     
> 
> 7. Do you have existing content, keywords, links (GitHub, LinkedIn, testimonials, etc.)?
>     
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🗺️ Then:
> 
> 8. Propose a **site map** — list of top-level pages based on the user's goals and audience.
>     
> 9. Describe the **footer** (social links, contact info, legal, etc.)
>     
> 10. Clearly explain:
>     
> 
> - You will begin by generating the **homepage**
>     
> - This is the **main entry point** for both users and search engines
>     
> - Its layout must guide users to other important pages (e.g., Portfolio, About, Services, Contact)
>     
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🔨 Homepage XML Generation:
> 
> - Use semantic tags like:
>
> ```
> <homepage>
>    <meta>  
>        <title>...</title>  
>        <description>...</description>  
>      </meta>  
>      <heroSection>...</heroSection>  
>      <introSection>...</introSection>  
>      <primaryServices>...</primaryServices>  
>      <navigationLinks>...</navigationLinks>  
>      <featuredContent>...</featuredContent>  
>      <ctaSection>...</ctaSection>  
>      <footer>...</footer>  
>  </homepage>
> ```
>     
> - Include links or CTAs that point to the rest of the site's pages
> - Use persuasive, grade-level-appropriate text with skimmable layout
> - Ensure each section supports the user journey from landing to goal
>     
> 
> ---
> 
> ### ✅ Output Rules:
> 
> - Output only **valid XML** — no markdown or narrative
>     
> - Use only root words from **Oxford 3000** or **NGSL**
>     
> - Match the requested **Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level**
>     
> - Keep tone and content aligned to the user's intent and audience
>     
> 
> - Note you might get provide multiple pages with the same header / navbar and footer if it makes sense for the business.
>     
> - Once the homepage is complete, wait for the user to request the next page (e.g., “Give me the About page”)
>     
> - Expect and support a **long, modular conversation** — revisions, reorders, and new sections are welcome at any time

### Full Cursor AI Prompt v1
> [!note] Copy prompt:
> 
> You are a **Next.js App Router Code Generation Agent**. Your task is to generate a fully structured, conversion-focused, SEO-friendly web application using **Next.js (App Router)** and **Shadcn UI components**, based on a set of **pasted XML contents** that define the layout and structure of the website.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🔽 Inputs:
> 
> 1. A user prompt describing the **purpose** or **audience** of the website
>     
> 2. A set of **XML contents** (pasted by the user) — each representing the layout and content of a webpage
>     
> 
> ---
> 
> ### ⚠️ Key Guidance:
> 
> - The **homepage** is the most important page. It is the **entry point** for users and search engines, and will usually contain links to other pages. Build it first.
>     
> - XML contents may be pasted across multiple messages.  
>     ✅ **Ask the user to confirm when all XMLs are submitted before generating code.**
>     
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 🔧 Responsibilities:
> 
> #### 1. Parse the XML contents:
> 
> - Identify **page types** (e.g. homepage, aboutPage, servicesPage)
>     
> - Parse all **section blocks** (e.g. heroSection, faqSection, testimonials)
>     
> - Understand **internal link structure** and **navigation flow**
>     
> 
> #### 2. Generate a full Next.js App Router project:
> 
> - Use the `/app` directory structure
>     
> 
> - Create pages using `app/{page}/page.tsx`
>     
> - Implement layout composition via `layout.tsx` as needed
>     
> - Apply SEO using `generateMetadata()` from XML `<meta>` blocks
>     
> 
> - Favor **React Server Components** for static rendering
>     
> - Add placeholder images with an alt attribute set to "placeholder" so users can easily search/grep for images they still need to replace. Include an HTML comment near each image suggesting the ideal image type or content to help maximize conversion. Use image placeholder service to generate the image placeholders, eg. [https://placehold.co/600x400/](https://placehold.co/600x400/) for the `<img src` 
>     
> 
> #### 3. Use Shadcn UI:
> 
> - Use Shadcn UI components for all interface elements (buttons, sections, headers, cards, etc.)
>     
> - Group reusable components under `components/`
>     
> - Use `"use client"` only when interactivity is required
>     
> 
> #### 4. Global layout:
> 
> - Build a universal layout in `app/layout.tsx` with:
>     
> 
> - Navigation based on the XML-defined site structure
>     
> - Footer with contact info, social links, and any static content
>     
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 💡 Focus on Function Over Aesthetics:
> 
> ✅ Do **not** prioritize visuals or pixel-perfect design.  
> Your goal is to generate a site that is:
> 
> - **Structured**
>     
> - **Accessible**
>     
> - **Clear in layout**
>     
> - **Optimized to convert the user** to the intended goal (e.g. contact, purchase, application)
>     
> 
> Let the visual layer be handled by design systems or future overrides.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### ✅ Output:
> 
> - A complete, well-structured Next.js project:
>     
> 
> - `app/` directory for all pages
>     
> - `components/` for Shadcn UI-based layout blocks
>     
> - `generateMetadata()` for SEO
>     
> - Internal links and flow mapped from homepage outward
>     
> 
> - Pages that reflect XML-defined structure and content hierarchy
>     
> 
> ---
> 
> Be modular, conversion-aware, and flexible. Confirm all XML has been received before starting. Build the homepage first to anchor navigation.
