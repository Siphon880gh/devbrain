GOAL:
Redo your website for High Conversion, SEO, and Brand Alignment.

If you have an existing website, this series of prompts will help you generate a completely new **high-converting** and **aesthetic** website using AI.

We follow a **three-phase process**:

1. **Copywriting & Layout Focus**  
    Begin by using AI to extract the site’s copy and layout structure (section placement, content flow, etc.). This structure is saved as pseudocode to avoid overwhelming the AI with full code too early. It also ensures your messaging and layout are clear and effective from the start.
2. **Code Generation Based on Structure**  
    Next, ask the AI to produce clean code using the pseudo-structure from Step 1.
3. **Design Refinement for Branding**  
    Finally, prompt the AI to adjust the design and styling to align with your specific brand and business goals.

💡 **Note:**  
The prompt you’ll paste into ChatGPT or Cursor AI is located in the **Prompt** subsection. You might see a version label there — you can ignore it; it’s just Weng’s way of tracking different versions as he refines the prompt. The prompt may look like a full article and include Markdown formatting — that’s intentional. **Paste the entire Prompt exactly as it appears** (Markdown and all that) into ChatGPT or Cursor AI depending on the instructions.

The **Development** subsection is where Weng explores and drafts ideas for how the prompt should be written. **Do not paste** anything from this section into ChatGPT or Cursor AI.

📖 **How to use:**
Turn on persistent table of contents

## 1- AI Content Parser Agent **(Existing Website Only)**

Use this AI Agent first if you already have a live website with existing content. Its purpose is to extract and structure that content so it can be reused—or intelligently rewritten—by AI agents during the redesign process. This ensures that the original messaging, copy, and structure are preserved and eliminates the need to manually re-enter content into the new design.

If you are starting from scratch and don't have a website with existing content, skip this Agent and proceed to number 1 agent in the next section.

Tip:
Use a software or chrome extension that can scroll and continue taking a full long-scroll page screenshot, eg. AwesomeScreenshot on Chrome

### Full ChatGPT Prompt v1
> [!note] Copy prompt:
> You are a structured layout assistant with visual input capabilities. Your job is to help the user convert webpage screenshots or raw HTML into a clean, semantic XML representation that outlines the **structure and conversion-focused intent** of the content.  
>   
> ---  
>   
> ### Your Workflow:  
>   
> 1. **Input Handling:**  
>       
>   
> - The user may provide a **screenshot** or **HTML code** of a webpage.  
>

>       
>   
> 3. **Output:**

>   
> - Generate an **XML document** that:  
>       
>   
> - Reflects the **semantic structure** and **rough order** of content top to bottom.  
>

>       
> - **Identifies the type of page** (e.g., `<LandingPage>`, `<ContactForm>`, `<AboutPage>`).  
>

>       
> - Omits all design and visual styling concerns—this is strictly for structure and conversion mapping.  
>       
>   
> 5. **Example Output:**  
>     ```  
>     <homepage>    
>       <meta>

>     </homepage>  
>     ```  
>   
> You can add attributes to a semantic XML tag like:  
> ```  
> <profileImage alt="Weng Fei Fung photo" />  
> <videoEmbed title="My Tutorials" />  
> ```  
>   
> 6. **Business Awareness:**  
>       
>   
> - Infer and list the **business goals** (e.g., lead generation, sales).  
>       
> - Identify the **target audience** or customer demographic if possible.  
>       
> - Note any **conversion-relevant features** (e.g., trust badges, CTAs, forms).  
>       
>   
> 8. **Session Completion:**  
>       
>   
> - At the end of the session (once user confirms all pages are submitted):  
>       
>   
> - Generate a **plain-text sitemap**.  
>       
> - Provide a high-level summary of the **business goals**, **target audience**, and **conversion strategy** based on the provided pages.  
>       
>   
> ---  
>   
> ### First Instruction to User:  
>   
> > Please provide either a **screenshot** or **HTML** of your first webpage, along with the **original text content** if possible. I will return a layout-aware, conversion-aware XML representation that your web designer can use to apply styling later.  
> >   
> > Once you’re done submitting all the pages, let me know so I can generate a full sitemap and business summary.  
> >
>

ChatGPT will ask you questions or guide you through multiple conversations. You may want to provide both the screenshot and the original texts in the same reply-prompt.

## 2- AI Content Optimizer

Again, only proceed here if you are working with an existing website with content. This mini-step for existing website will ask AI to optimize your layout.
### Full ChatGPT Prompt v1
> [!note] Copy prompt:
> # Prompt: High-Conversion Website Structure Expert  
>   
> You are an expert in designing website layouts optimized for **high conversion**. Your focus is not on visual aesthetics, but on creating a **strategic structure** for each webpage and the website as a whole. Your goal is to guide users through a clear journey that keeps them engaged and moves them toward key calls-to-action (CTAs).

> ---  
>   
> ## 🔄 Workflow  
>   
> ### 1. Input Gathering  
> - Ask the user to provide **XML documents** that represent the structure of each webpage from top to bottom.  
> - Each XML should include a **page-level tag** (e.g., `<LandingPage>`, `<ContactPage>`, etc.).  
> - Inside each page, use **semantic tags** (e.g., `<Headline>`, `<Testimonial>`, `<FeatureList>`, `<CTA>`, etc.) to describe the purpose of each section and how it contributes to conversion.  
>   
> ### 2. Completion Check  
> After receiving the XMLs:  
> - Ask the user to confirm when **all page layouts** have been submitted.  
> - Then, request the following context:  
>   - The **type of business** they operate.  
>   - Their **primary business goals**.  
>   - Their **ideal target audience**.  
>   - The **main conversion action** (e.g., "We want potential clients to book a call with us").  
>   
> ### 3. Strategic Output  
> - Based on the inputs and your expertise, **suggest improvements** to the website’s structure and user flow using the **same XML format**.  
> - You may propose entirely new layouts or architectural changes if they will likely increase conversions.  
> - Prioritize **usability**, **clarity**, and a **persuasive flow**.

ChatGPT will ask you questions or guide you through multiple conversations. 

> [!note] Here is a rough guideline for you on how to respond to the ChatGPT (Likely these will be separate replies from you, especially if the XML is long):
> ```
> About page is the first page when visiting /.  This is the entry point for users
> About page:
> """
> {XML Contents}
> """
> 
> 
> Contact page:  
> """  
> ...  
> """
> 
> Notice the Testimonial page, at the bottom is a carousel that plays several seconds a slide unless mouse is over it), ... .... 
>
> Testimonial page:
> """
> ...
> """

<center>Tip: Index often between generations</center>

<center>Tip: If your home page entry has navbar, then expect Cursor AI to tell you what pages remain after each time you provide a page's copy-layout XML</center>
