As long as you have some basic business requirements, following these series of prompts will create a high converting and aesthetic website. We focus first on generating the copywrite and layout / placement without overwhelming the AI with actual code. Then we ask to to create a clean code based on the pseudo code that focused on copywriting and layout / placement. Then, we ask it to redesign it to fit our business needs and brand.

## 1- NEW - Plain ugly high conversion website content planner:

AI generates copywrite layout XML's from business needs. AI will ask the user clarifying questions to understand their business needs and goals.

### Development - Original Prompt

> Propose a structured syntax or lightweight XML/JSON format that copywriters can use to communicate website content and layout intent to AI models or developers. The format should support defining high-converting page sections (e.g., headlines, hero images, CTAs, testimonials, product features) and help bridge the gap between copywriting and design implementation for web pages optimized for conversion.
