### **Web Scraping: How to Choose the Right Tool or Approach**

When evaluating scraping tools or platforms, it’s important to weigh your technical skill, use case, and budget. Below are the key criteria and tradeoffs to consider.

---

### **1. Pricing & Usage Limits**

- **Free vs. Paid**: Does the service offer a one-time free credit or monthly free quota? Can unused credits roll over? Some services offer credits for a trial period (Eg. Oxylabs Web Scraper API, as of 6/2025)
    
- **Rate Limits**: Are there restrictions per second, per minute, per hour, or per day? (Eg. Crawlbase limits you to 20 requests a second, as of 6/2025)
    
- **Cost Scaling**: How does pricing change as your volume increases?

### **2. UI Wizard vs. Custom Code**

- **Visual Tools**: Some platforms offer drag-and-drop or point-and-click interfaces. These are ideal for non-coders.
    
- **Code-Based Tools**: With custom scripts, you get more control using libraries like **Scrapy**, **Playwright**, or **Puppeteer**, but this requires coding knowledge.
    
- **Hybrid Options**: Services like **Apify** and **Zyte** offer both a visual UI and developer SDKs.

### **3. Proxy Requirements & Bot Detection**

- **Built-in Proxy Support**: Does the service handle proxy rotation for you, or do you need to bring your own?
    
- **Residential vs. Datacenter IPs**: Residential IPs are more expensive but harder to detect and block. Datacenter IPs are cheaper but more likely to trigger bot defenses.
    
- **Beyond IP Detection**: Some bot protections (like browser fingerprinting or behavioral detection) aren’t tied to IP. If you're coding your own scraper, you may need to implement evasion tactics manually.
    
- **CAPTCHA Handling**: Frequent failures may stem from CAPTCHA walls. Some platforms have CAPTCHA solvers; otherwise, you'll need workarounds or to rotate to another tool.
    
- **Anti-Bot Services to Test Against**:
    
    - **Cloudflare**
        
    - **Imperva Incapsula** (e.g. protects [7-eleven.com](https://7-eleven.com/) as of June 2025 – good for testing scraper stealth)

### **4. Scheduling, Scalability & Reliability**

- **Job Scheduling**: Do you need scraping tasks run on a schedule (hourly, daily, etc.)? Can their service schedule for you or you're custom coding it?
    
- **Parallel Processing**: Does the tool support multithreading or batch execution for faster scraping?
    
- **Failure Handling**:
    - If pages fail to scrape, can your code retry or switch to an alternative scraper? if retrying, how long the wait first?
    - Is it easy to swap tools if one becomes unreliable?


---

### **5. Performance & Output Format**

- **Speed**: Does it take seconds or minutes to scrape a single page? This impacts scaling. Will your code timeout if it does take long?
    
- **Reliability**: High failure rates may mean anti-bot defenses are being triggered, or that your proxies or user agents are insufficient.
    
- **Output Format**:
    
    - JSON or CSV structured data?
        
    - Raw HTML (which you'll have to parse/clean)?
    
- **Sync vs. Async**: Does the API wait for a response (synchronous), or is the job queued and retrieved later (asynchronous)? If it's asynchronous, does the response provide a job_id, what's the api end point to check the status of the job, then what's the api endpoint to download results from the endpoint?
	- Eg. Oxylabs will provide a job_id as well as the api endpoints to its results. There are various api_endpoints for different formats of the results.

### **Tool Recommendations**

#### **No-Code / Visual Scrapers**

- **ParseHub**, **Octoparse**, **WebScraper.io**: Great for simple sites with low protection. Easy to use but limited scalability and control.
    

#### **Code-Based Frameworks**

- **Scrapy**, **Playwright**, **Puppeteer**, **Beautiful Soup**: High flexibility and control. You’ll need to handle anti-bot defenses and proxy integration yourself.
- Phantomjs, CasperJS

#### **Hybrid Platforms**

- **Apify**, **Zyte**: Offer UIs for fast prototyping and APIs/SDKs for scale. Ideal for mixed skill teams or when you want to move fast without heavy infrastructure setup.
