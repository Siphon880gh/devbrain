**TLDR:** Once you start scraping large volumes of data, you’ll need to think about both **where** you’re storing all that data (e.g., a data lake or warehouse like AWS S3, Snowflake, Redshift, etc.) and **how** you’re scaling the infrastructure (e.g., AWS Auto Scaling, container orchestration, or serverless) to handle the increased load. 
- Examples of large data are reddit comments, youtube comments, etc.

### 1. Data Storage & Processing

1. **Data Lake (e.g., AWS S3)**
	- Often the first place to dump raw or semi-structured data.
	- Great for staging data before additional transformations or loading into a data warehouse.
	- Inexpensive for storage and straightforward to integrate with many analytics tools.

2. **Data Warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery)**
	- Ideal for analytics, reporting, and running complex SQL queries on large datasets.
	- Snowflake is cloud-based and can scale storage and compute independently, making it flexible for big data analytics.
	- Redshift (AWS) and BigQuery (Google Cloud) are other popular warehouse solutions.

3. **ETL or ELT Pipelines**
	- Use a tool such as AWS Glue, dbt, Airflow, or a custom pipeline to transform or clean your scraped data and load it into your data lake or warehouse.
	- Automate these processes via scheduling or event-based triggers.

### 2. Infrastructure & Scaling Scraping Operations

1. **Horizontal Scaling with Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)**
	- In AWS, you can spin up multiple EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling Group.
	- The group can increase or decrease the number of instances based on metrics like CPU usage, network IO, or a custom metric (e.g., length of a job queue).

2. **Containers (ECS / EKS / Kubernetes)**
	- Dockerize your scraper (along with any browser drivers, dependencies, etc.).
	- Orchestrate containers using AWS ECS or AWS EKS (Kubernetes) to spin up multiple scraper tasks in parallel.
	- Scale container tasks automatically based on CPU/memory utilization or a message queue (e.g., SQS).

3. **Serverless Approaches**
	- **AWS Lambda** can be used for lighter-weight scraping tasks (especially if you don’t need a headless browser, or you can run a “headless Chrome” layer in Lambda).
	- **Serverless Containers** (e.g., AWS Fargate) can also handle tasks that need more resources than Lambda typically provides.

4. **Queue-Based Architecture**
	- Use an SQS queue (or RabbitMQ, Kafka) to distribute scraping tasks.
	- A set of worker instances or containers pulls tasks from the queue, processes them, and stores the results.
	- This pattern helps manage concurrency and ensures robust handling of large workloads.

5. **Monitoring & Logging**
	- Use AWS CloudWatch for logs and metrics, or a specialized logging platform (e.g., ELK stack, Datadog, Splunk).
	- Helps you see how each scraper instance is performing and scale up/down accordingly.

### 3. Best Practices & Considerations

1. **Respect Robots.txt & Terms of Service**
	- Make sure your scaling doesn’t violate any site policies or overwhelm the servers you’re scraping.

2. **Use Proxies & Rotating IPs (If Permitted)**
	- Large-scale scraping often requires proxy management (to avoid IP blocks).
	- Services like Bright Data, Oxylabs, or your own proxy setup can distribute requests from different IP ranges.

3. **Manage Retries & Error Handling**
	- Large-scale scraping can lead to transient errors (timeouts, Captchas, server errors).
	- Implement robust retry logic and backoff strategies to avoid infinite loops.

4. **Cost Management**
	- Spinning up multiple containers or EC2 instances can quickly become expensive.
	- Keep track of usage, use spot instances if viable, and scale down aggressively when not needed.

5. **Data Pipeline Orchestration**
	- Tools like Airflow, Prefect, or Dagster can schedule, monitor, and manage your data pipeline (scraping, transformations, loading) at scale.

### Example: Scalable Scraping Architecture on AWS

1. **Scraper Container**: A Docker image with Puppeteer/Playwright or your scraping logic.
2. **Task Distribution**: An AWS SQS queue where each message contains the URL or job parameters.
3. **ECS / Fargate**: Each container reads one message, scrapes the site, and stores the raw data in S3.
4. **Data Lake / Warehouse**: S3 (for raw data) + Snowflake (for analytics).
5. **Orchestration**: Airflow or Step Functions triggers the scraping job on a schedule or event.
6. **Auto Scaling**: ECS scales the number of tasks based on queue length.
7. **Processing / Transformation**: Another set of tasks/containers or an ETL job (e.g., AWS Glue) processes data from S3 into a cleaned format for Snowflake.

**Result:** A fully automated system that scrapes at high volume, stores data in a central lake, and allows business/analytics teams to run queries and generate insights.
