You make sure to click "URLs" instead of calendar:

Then clicking that link will open the PDF exactly as captured. The URL is similar to:
https://web.archive.org/web/20240100190000/https://domain.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/How-To-Input.pdf⁩

Common doc formats you may want to look for (not just PDF):
PDF, doc, docx, ppt

This is despite even the website being shut down:
404 at https://domain.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/How-To-Input.pdf⁩

If website was/is wordpress, you have an even easier method to get all the PDF, doc, docx, ppt:
- Search partially at URL: `https://domain.com/wp-contents/uploads`
