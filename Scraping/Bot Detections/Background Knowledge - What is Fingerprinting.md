## 🧬 What Is Browser Fingerprinting?

**Browser fingerprinting** is a method websites use to uniquely identify your device based on your browser and system settings — _without using cookies_.

When you visit a website, it can gather information like:

- Your **screen size and resolution**
    
- Your **browser type and version**
    
- Installed **fonts** and **plugins**
    
- Your **timezone**, **language**, and **operating system**
    
- Results from **canvas**, **WebGL**, or **audio rendering tests**
    

More examples of what gets collected:

- Your browser type and version (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
    
- Operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.)
    
- Screen resolution and color depth
    
- Installed fonts
    
- Timezone and language settings
    
- List of installed browser plugins or extensions
    
- WebGL and Canvas rendering (how your device draws graphics)
    
- Device memory and CPU info
    
- Touchscreen support
    

Each of these details alone isn’t unique—but **combined, they create a profile that is statistically rare** and can often identify you even without traditional tracking tools. These details, when combined, form a “fingerprint”.

You can simulate this through the library FingerprintJS library. It can generate a unique visitor ID that's tied to the device.

### 🕵️ Why Is It Used?

- To **detect bots** or headless browsers
    
- To **prevent fraud** or multi-accounting
    
- For **analytics** and **ad tracking** (less ethical use)
	- How does tracking technology follow your trail around the web, even if you’ve taken protective measures (block cookies, use incognito mode, or change IP addresses)? It tracks you by the fingerprint of your browser’s most unique and identifying characteristics.

### 🔐 Can You Avoid It?

Fingerprinting is hard to block entirely, but you can reduce tracking risk by:

- Using privacy-focused browsers (like Brave or Firefox with strict settings)
    
- Disabling JavaScript (though it breaks many sites)
    
- Using tools like uBlock Origin or anti-fingerprinting extensions
