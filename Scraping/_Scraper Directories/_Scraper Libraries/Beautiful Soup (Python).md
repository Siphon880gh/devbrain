**Beautiful Soup** is a powerful Python library designed for parsing HTML and XML documents, even if they contain messy or malformed markup. It creates a structured **parse tree** that makes it easy to navigate and extract specific elements, text, or attributes. This is especially useful for **web scraping**, where you need to collect data from websites for analysis, automation, or integration into other tools. Beautiful Soup works well alongside libraries like `requests` to download and process web content efficiently.
