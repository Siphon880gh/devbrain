Reminder that headless is a script that runs in the background to scrape websites, usually requiring smart engineering of sending headers including sessions to fake you are a real user and rotating ip addresses as well. Using puppeteer to simulate user behavior headless - you can't see what's really going on

So a good practice is to figure out how to get the information from the page using a similar puppeteer code while headful (like it's actually done visible in your web browser). You can run puppetter headful or you can use the chrome extension puppeteer IDE and it can be your headful puppeteer
