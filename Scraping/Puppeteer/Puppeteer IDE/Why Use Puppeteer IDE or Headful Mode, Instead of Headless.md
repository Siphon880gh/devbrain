Titled: Why Use Puppeteer IDE or Headful Mode, Instead of Headless

If you want to **test your scraping logic first**, watch it interact with the page, and debug in real time, then using Puppeteer in **headful mode** (or via the Puppeteer IDE) is the way to go. It lets you see exactly how your script behaves—clicking buttons, filling forms, scrolling, etc.—before you let it run automatically in headless mode behind the scenes.

Headful mode is also helpful if you:

- Prefer to **leave the computer running** unattended without setting up more complex automation
- Want to avoid **paying for IP rotation or proxy services**
- Want a scraping method that **looks more like a real user**, which can help reduce the chance of getting blocked

That said, using a VPN is still a good idea, since some sites may block you based on behavior or IP regardless.

A few caveats:
- The Puppeteer IDE doesn’t always show errors. Some actions (like `page.waitForXPath()`) may silently fail even though they appear in autocomplete.
- Data logged with `console.log()` goes to the browser’s **Console tab**, not directly to the Puppeteer IDE.

Overall, headful mode gives you more visibility and control while developing your script—perfect for refining your scraping before going fully automated.
