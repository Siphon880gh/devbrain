## Scheduling the scraping

You can use a cron job to run your scraping scripts automatically at fixed intervals. It’s a common way to perform scheduled scraping jobs.

### How It Works

1. **Write Your Scraper**
	- For example, using Puppeteer in Node.js, a Python script with Scrapy, Selenium, or Playwright, etc.
2. **Make It Self-Contained**
	- Ensure your script can be executed from the command line (e.g., `node scraper.js` or `python scraper.py`) without additional manual steps.
3. **Add a Cron Job** (Linux/macOS)
	- Open the cron editor with:
	```
	crontab -e
	```
    
	- Add a line with the schedule and command. For instance, run the script every day at 1 AM:
	```
	0 1 * * * /usr/bin/node /path/to/your/scraper.js
	```
	- The format is `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week command`.

	- At 01:00 every day is: `0 1 * * *`

4. **Check Logs & Output**

	- Make sure to log output or errors to a file or somewhere you can review them:
		```
		0 1 * * * /usr/bin/node /path/to/your/scraper.js >> /path/to/log.log 2>&1
		```
    
	- This redirects both standard output (stdout) and error output (stderr) to `log.log`.

### Tips for Scheduled Scraping

- **Separate Credentials/Config:** Store secrets or login info in environment variables or a config file, so you don’t commit them to version control.
- **Error Handling & Logging:** If something breaks at 3 AM, you’ll want logs to help you debug quickly.
- **Resource Usage & Delays:**
	- If you’re scraping a large number of pages, consider setting random delays or respecting the website’s robots.txt and rate limits.
- **Use a Virtual Environment (Python)** if you’re using Python to avoid dependency conflicts.

### Example: Simple Cron Entry

Let’s assume you have a Node.js script at `/home/user/my-scraper/scraper.js` and you want to run it every day at 6 AM. You would do:

```
crontab -e  
# Then add the following line:  
0 6 * * * /usr/bin/node /home/user/my-scraper/scraper.js >> /home/user/my-scraper/scraper.log 2>&1
```

That’s it! You now have a scheduled scraping job.
