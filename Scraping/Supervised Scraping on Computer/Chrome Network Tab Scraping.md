Situation: A webpage has a lot of data points but doesn't make it easy for you to export data for your own use.

Data often found in Chrome DevTools network tab. However you want to restart the webpage with the network tab on, otherwise may not show up the content that gets sent to the webpage during the loading.

You may want to disable cache and filter by Fetch/XHR depending on use case. JSON files, XML files, even txt files may apply. “Response” tab has unprettied json but clicking “Preview” will have easier to read prettified json. Look for keys that could be “data” or named after what type of data you’re looking for. 

Depending on VA’s technical abilities:

- Can have VA go through Network tab and save the data
- Or you can streamline it for them (requires more development): Once you establish this, you can have VA save data or write a script in Google Chrome that detects the web address then performs the data collection. The data collection could be changed into file download links that get appended to the page for the VA to click. 

The data format may not be plain text. It may be other file extensions that are meant to be opened in other apps but have been handled to render on the website. If you need converting, try dropping the files into an AI Chat and asking it to translate. If you’re restricted because of file types, then open Cursor AI in Composer Mode, feeding in the file in the current opened folder, and instructions to convert to json or a list (Always offer json as an option). It may create a python script for you to run against the file.
