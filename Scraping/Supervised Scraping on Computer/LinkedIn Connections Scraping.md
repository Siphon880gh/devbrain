Can have an autoclicker like https://www.murgaa.com/auto-clicker-mac/ (depends on your OS)

And have it clicked like the second one every few seconds.

But 250 profile views per day for free plans and 1,000 profile views per day for paid plan.

Note LinkedIn monitors behaviors. Make sure your click macro solution has a random delay or random "behaviors" between profile opens (eg. opening a post on the new connection's profile).

VAs?

VAs with LinkedIn accounts can be trained to repeat the same procedure to scrape more profiles in a day.
