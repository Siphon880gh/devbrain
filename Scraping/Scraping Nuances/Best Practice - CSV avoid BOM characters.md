Sometime's there an invisible character called the BOM (Byte Order Mark) character `` at the beginning of the CSV file.

For example, in parsing the csv in your app, the BOM character could cause the key to be  `firstColumn`  instead of just `firstColumn` , so `$row['firstColumn']`  returns null for every row!

In PHP, you can fix this by removing the BOM from the headers row:
```
if ($headers && !empty($headers[0])) {  
	$headers[0] = preg_replace('/^\xEF\xBB\xBF/', '', $headers[0]);  
}
```

To **resave a CSV file from the command line** while removing the BOM (Byte Order Mark), here's a reliable method depending on your platform:

---

### 🐧 **On Linux / macOS (using `iconv`)**

```
iconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -c original.csv > cleaned.csv
```

If you suspect a BOM, you can explicitly handle it:

```
iconv -f utf-8-sig -t utf-8 original.csv > cleaned.csv
```

> `utf-8-sig` will detect and strip the BOM if present. `-c` removes invalid characters silently.

---

### 🪟 **On Windows (using PowerShell)**

Get-Content original.csv | Set-Content -Encoding UTF8 cleaned.csv

> ⚠️ Make sure **not** to use `-Encoding UTF8BOM` if you want to remove the BOM.

---

### 🐍 **Python (cross-platform option)**

```
python -c "open('cleaned.csv', 'w', encoding='utf-8').write(open('original.csv', encoding='utf-8-sig').read())"
```

This:
- Reads using `utf-8-sig` (which removes BOM if found)
- Writes with plain `utf-8` (no BOM)

### 🧠 What is BOM?

- BOM = **Byte Order Mark**
    
- It's a special, invisible character placed at the **very start of a file**
    
- In **UTF-8**, it appears as: `\ufeff` or `0xEF 0xBB 0xBF` (in hex bytes)
    
- It tells programs: "This file is encoded as Unicode (UTF-8/UTF-16), so treat it accordingly."
    
- The **Byte Order Mark (BOM)** comes from the world of Unicode encoding — specifically from **UTF-16** and **UTF-8 with signature (UTF-8-SIG)** — and is used to signal the encoding of a text file.

### 🛠️ Where does BOM come from?

#### 1. **Microsoft Excel / Notepad**
- When you save a CSV from Excel **as UTF-8**, it adds a BOM (`utf-8-sig`)
- Older versions of Excel **require** the BOM to recognize UTF-8 as Unicode (especially for non-ASCII characters like emojis or accented letters)
#### 2. **Web scrapers or web servers**
- Some websites or APIs may send content with a BOM in the response body (especially from Microsoft tech stacks or Java-based backends)
- If you scrape raw text or CSV content directly, you may unknowingly capture the BOM
#### 3. **Manual file conversion**
- Using `iconv`, Notepad++, or similar tools may insert BOM depending on export options
- Even some **Python writers** will add BOM if you use `utf-8-sig` in `open()` when saving

---

### 🔥 Why it causes problems
- Programming languages like Python don’t expect a BOM in UTF-8 (it's not required)
- So column headers like `'name'` may become `'\ufeffname'`
- This silently breaks string comparisons and column lookups

### 📌 In Summary

| Source                  | BOM likely? | Notes                              |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Excel (UTF-8)           | ✅ Yes       | Adds BOM for compatibility         |
| Notepad / WordPad       | ✅ Yes       | If saved as UTF-8                  |
| Python                  | ❌ No        | Unless `encoding='utf-8-sig'` used |
| Linux tools (cat, echo) | ❌ No        | Typically clean                    |
| Websites                | ⚠️ Maybe    | Depends on server headers          |
