### 🧩 Open Source Apps as Core Building Blocks

Companies can leverage open-source apps as the **foundation** of their software stack — whether it's customer-facing tools or backend services. These apps provide prebuilt functionality, often with active communities and commercial-grade features, allowing teams to avoid building everything from scratch.

Examples include:

- **Frontend or fullstack platforms**:
    - **Focalboard** – for project and task management
    - **Botpress V12** – for building conversational agents
    - **Outline** – for internal wikis or documentation

- **Backend services**:
    
    - **n8n** – for workflow automation
    - **Keycloak** – for authentication and identity
    - **PostHog** – for product analytics
        

With permissive licenses like MIT or Apache 2.0, companies are free to:

- Modify the source code to match business needs
- Rebrand and customize the UI/UX
- Integrate these tools into their own infrastructure
- Offer them as part of their commercial product or platform

By using open-source apps as ready-made components, companies accelerate development, maintain full control, and build software that feels entirely their own — all while standing on the shoulders of proven, well-maintained systems.

### ⚙️ CLI Tools: Powering Web Features Behind the Scenes

Command-line utilities are the **quiet workhorses** that enable many modern web services. When installed on a server or run in containers, they can process media, convert files, and handle tasks typically hidden from users.

Popular examples:

- `ffmpeg` – compress and convert video/audio
- `magick` (ImageMagick) – resize, crop, or convert images
- `wkhtmltoimage`, `puppeteer` – convert HTML to images or PDFs
    

These can be used to build production tools like:

> **CompressMyVideo.com** (hypothetical): A service where users upload videos, and the server uses `ffmpeg` to compress them before returning the optimized version.

Because these CLI tools are **scriptable, stable, and efficient**, they're ideal for use in backends or API-driven platforms.

### 🧱 A Complete Open Source Stack

By combining:
- **Self-hosted frontend apps**
- **Backend services for logic, auth, and analytics**
- **CLI tools for file/media processing**
- **Docker for deployment and isolation**

...companies can assemble scalable, production-grade systems without high licensing fees or vendor lock-in.

### 🚀 Why It Works

Building with open source:
- Reduces development time and cost
- Gives full control over customization and branding
- Lets companies own their infrastructure and data
- Enables both internal tools and customer-facing products

With proper configuration, these tools can become part of a reliable, branded platform — **your company’s product, powered by the open-source community**.
