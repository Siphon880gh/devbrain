AKA: Getting Started

A **cron job** is a scheduled command that your Linux server runs automatically at specific times. It's a great way to automate tasks like certificate renewals, backups, or health checks.

### Example

This command runs every day at 3:00 AM to silently renew SSL certificates and reload NGINX if needed:

```
0 3 * * * certbot renew --quiet && systemctl reload nginx
```

## 🚀 How to Set Up a Cron Job

1. SSH into your server with root access.
    
2. Launch the cron editor:
    
    ```
    sudo crontab -e
    ```
    
3. On your first run, you’ll be asked to choose a text editor. Just type the number that corresponds to your preferred one (e.g., `1` for nano, `2` for vi).
    
    For example, if you select `vi`, your terminal might look like this:

## 📅 Cron Syntax Breakdown

Each cron job follows this structure:

```
* * * * * /path/to/command
| | | | |
| | | | └──── Day of the week (0 - 7) [Sunday = 0 or 7]
| | | └────── Month (1 - 12)
| | └──────── Day of the month (1 - 31)
| └────────── Hour (0 - 23)
└──────────── Minute (0 - 59)
```

The `*` symbol means “every possible value” in that position. You can also use **division syntax** (`*/N`) to create intervals.

### Examples:

#### 🔁 Every 5 Minutes

```
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/heartbeat.sh
```

Runs **every 5 minutes**. The `*/5` in the minute field means "every 5th minute": 0, 5, 10, 15, etc.

#### 🕑 Every 2 Hours

```
0 */2 * * * /usr/bin/report.sh
```

Runs **every 2 hours** on the hour. The `*/2` in the **hour** field means it runs at 0:00, 2:00, 4:00, and so on. The `0` in the minute field means it triggers at the start of the hour.

#### 📦 Weekly Backup

```
15 5 * * 1 /usr/bin/backup.sh
```

Runs **every Monday at 5:15 AM**.

## 🗂️ Adding Multiple Cron Jobs

You can include **multiple cron jobs** in the same file by adding one job per line:

```
0 3 * * * certbot renew --quiet && systemctl reload nginx
30 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/db-backup.sh
0 */6 * * * /usr/local/bin/server-health-check.sh
```

**Tips:**

- Each line is a separate task.
    
- Use full paths to executables (`/usr/bin/your-command`) to avoid path issues.
    
- You can include comments in the file using `#`:
    
    ```
    # Renew SSL daily at 3 AM
    0 3 * * * certbot renew --quiet && systemctl reload nginx
    ```
