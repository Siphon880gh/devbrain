`jq` is a lightweight, flexible command-line tool for working with JSON data. Think of it as `sed` or `awk` but for JSON â€” it allows you to slice, filter, map, and transform structured data efficiently.

**Installation for local development and testing before deploying:**
- **macOS**: `brew install jq`
- **Windows**: `choco install jq`

**Installation likely for production server:** 
- **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt install jq`
- **RedHat/CentOS**: `sudo yum install jq`

This tool is especially useful for backend systems where data is stored as JSON files. For example, a website that needs to search through large volumes of structured data can use `jq` as a powerful CLI-driven processing layer.
