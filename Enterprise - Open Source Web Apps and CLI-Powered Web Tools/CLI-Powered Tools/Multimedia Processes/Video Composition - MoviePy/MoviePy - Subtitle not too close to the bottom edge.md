To adjust the vertical position of the text, you'll want to modify the `set_position` parameter for each `txt_clip`. Since you want the text to be a little higher by 5 pixels, you would adjust the 'bottom' position by subtracting 5 pixels from the y-coordinate of the text clip position.

The `set_position` function can take a tuple with the format `(x, y)`, where `x` represents the horizontal position and `y` represents the vertical position. The coordinates are relative to the screen, with `(0, 0)` being the top-left corner.

Here's how you can adjust the `set_position` call:

```python
text_clips = []
for subtitle in SUBTITLES:
    
    txt_clip = TextClip(subtitle["text"], fontsize=24, color='white', bg_color='black', font='Arial')
    
    # Set the text position. ('center', 'bottom') positions it at the bottom-center.
    # We subtract 20 from the height of the video to raise the text slightly higher than the bottom.
    txt_position = ('center', video.size[1] - txt_clip.size[1] - 20)
    
    txt_clip = txt_clip.set_position(txt_position).set_start(subtitle["start_time"])\
                       .set_duration(subtitle["end_time"] - subtitle["start_time"])
    
    text_clips.append(txt_clip)

composite = CompositeVideoClip([video] + text_clips)
composite.write_videofile('subbed.mp4', codec='libx264', audio_codec='aac')
```

This code calculates the position of the text based on the height of the video minus the height of the text clip itself, and then moves it up by an additional 5 pixels. Remember that this calculation will place the text at the same height throughout the video, so if the video has different aspect ratios or sizes for different parts, this might not work as expected.
