### SVG to PNG Conversion: Why `convert` Might Fail and What to Use Instead

If you’ve tried converting an SVG with ImageMagick like this:

```bash
convert arie.com.svg arie.com.png
```

And got an error like:

```
convert: non-conforming drawing primitive definition `c1-.725' @ error/draw.c/TracePath/6762.
```

…it’s likely due to **malformed or shorthand SVG path commands** that `convert` doesn't fully support. While `convert` is a common go-to command, it's not ideal for SVGs — and **it isn’t fully cross-platform reliable**.

### ✅ Better Option: `rsvg-convert` (Cross-Platform, SVG-Specific)

`rsvg-convert` is purpose-built for handling SVGs correctly and consistently:

```bash
rsvg-convert -o arie.com.png arie.com.svg
```

**Install it with:**

- **macOS (Homebrew):**
    
    ```bash
    brew install librsvg
    ```
    
- **Ubuntu/Debian:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install librsvg2-bin
    ```

### 🔁 Alternative: Use `sharp` (Node.js-Based and Version-Controlled)

For consistent behavior across platforms and environments, consider using [`sharp`](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/), a high-performance Node.js image processing library:

```js
const sharp = require('sharp');

sharp('Moes_LOGO.svg')
  .png()
  .toFile('Moes_LOGO.png')
  .then(() => console.log('Converted!'));
```

This approach is especially useful if you're already using Node.js and want to ensure consistent results using a specific `sharp` version via `nvm`.

**In short:**  
`convert` is familiar but unreliable for SVGs. Use `rsvg-convert` for better cross-platform handling, or switch to `sharp` for a modern, scriptable solution.
