 If you setup the subdomain as the url to a web page (rather it's reverse proxy to a port number locally on the webhost network or opens another folder as root), then you'll have to make sure your DNS is good (CNAME subdomain pointed to domain) and that https is good (Adding the new subdomain to your TSL/SSL certificate), but of course you don't want the subdomain to point anywhere else other than the actual root of your website when re-generating the TSL/SSL/https because it has to accurately produce an ACME challenge that can be reached at http:// (and it creates the ACME file relative to your true root).
