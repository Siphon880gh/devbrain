**Note:** Installation guides have been moved to the internal business notes. This is because tools like Trelium and Focalboard were primarily used for internal team collaboration, rather than as platforms intended for public-facing deployment or resale.

That said, the guides are still valuable to review. They cover important steps such as:

* Cloning the open-source project (typically from GitHub)
* Understanding its license and legal implications
* Testing and running the app locally
* Deploying it to a public server
* Setting up a reverse proxy to avoid issues like mixed HTTP/HTTPS content or exposing non-standard ports

These instructions are especially useful when evaluating or repurposing open-source apps for product development use.
