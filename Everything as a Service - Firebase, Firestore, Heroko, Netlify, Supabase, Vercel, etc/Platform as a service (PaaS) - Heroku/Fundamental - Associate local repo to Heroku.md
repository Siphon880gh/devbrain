If you've connected your GitHub repository to Heroku via the dashboard, you might expect everything to ‚Äújust work‚Äù ‚Äî and it mostly does. New commits to the `main` branch can automatically trigger deployments to Heroku. However, if your app crashes after deployment and you try to run commands like `heroku logs --tail` from your terminal, you may encounter an error like:

```
 ‚ñ∏    No app specified.
 ‚ñ∏    Run this command from an app folder or specify which app to use with --app.
```

This means your **local Git repository isn‚Äôt associated with the Heroku app**, even though the GitHub repo is connected via the Heroku dashboard. This is a common source of confusion, especially when teams use the dashboard for deployment but the CLI for debugging.

## ‚úÖ How to Fix It: Two Ways to Associate the Repo

You have two options to link your local repo with the Heroku app:

### 1. **Add Heroku as a Git Remote**

You can manually add the Heroku app as a Git remote. First, go to the **Settings** tab of your app in the [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/), scroll down to **"Heroku Git URL"**, and copy the URL (it‚Äôll look like `https://git.heroku.com/your-app-name.git`).

Then in your local repo:

```bash
git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/your-app-name.git
```

Now you can push manually with:

```bash
git push heroku main
```

And you‚Äôll be able to use CLI commands like:

```bash
heroku logs --tail
```

### 2. **Use the Heroku CLI to Associate the App**

If you prefer to skip Git remotes, use the Heroku CLI to associate the app by name:

```bash
heroku git:remote -a your-app-name
```

This creates the `heroku` Git remote automatically. It also allows all Heroku CLI commands to work from that directory just like method 1 (Adding a Git remote called Heroku to the app's Heroku .git url).

## üí° Already Associated?

If you created the Heroku app from your terminal using something like:

```bash
heroku create your-app-name
```

Then the association was already set up. You can confirm with:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see something like:

```
heroku  https://git.heroku.com/your-app-name.git (fetch)
heroku  https://git.heroku.com/your-app-name.git (push)
```

---

## üöÄ TL;DR

Even if your GitHub repo is connected to Heroku, you need to **manually associate the local repo** with Heroku for CLI commands like `heroku logs` to work. Either:

- Add the Git remote manually, or
    
- Run `heroku git:remote -a your-app-name`
    

This small setup step gives you full access to logs, restarts, and debugging right from the terminal.
