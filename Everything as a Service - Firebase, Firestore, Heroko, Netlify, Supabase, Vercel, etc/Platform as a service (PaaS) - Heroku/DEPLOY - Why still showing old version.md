## üîÅ Heroku Deployment Shows Old Version? Here‚Äôs How to Fix It

You‚Äôve pushed changes to Heroku, the dashboard says ‚ÄúBuild succeeded,‚Äù but your app still shows the **old version**. Here are the most common reasons why ‚Äî and how to fix each one.

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Browser or CDN Cache**

Your browser (or a CDN like Cloudflare) might be serving a cached version of your site.

**Fix:**
- Hard refresh:  
    `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)
- Try Incognito/Private Mode
- Purge cache on CDN dashboard if applicable

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Heroku Didn‚Äôt Restart Dynos**

Heroku may have deployed your code, but didn‚Äôt fully restart the dynos.

**Fix:**
```bash
heroku restart -a your-app-name
```

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Wrong Git Branch Deployed**

You might‚Äôve committed changes to one branch but pushed another.

**Fix:**
```bash
git branch             # Confirm your current branch
git push heroku main   # Or git push heroku your-branch:main
```

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Build Step Not Run (Static Sites)**

For frontend frameworks (React, Vue, etc.), you must run the build before deploying.

**Fix:**
```bash
npm run build
git add .
git commit -m "Rebuilt with latest changes"
git push heroku main
```

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **Wrong Heroku App Remote**

You might be pushing to a different Heroku app (like a staging version).

**Fix:**
```bash
git remote -v              # Check which app you're pushing to
heroku apps                # See all your apps
heroku git:remote -a your-app-name   # Set correct app
```

---

### ‚úÖ 6. **Express Server: Serving the Wrong Folder**

If you're using Express, **make sure you're serving the `dist/` or `build/` folder**, not an outdated `public/` folder.

**Example Fix:**
```js
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'dist')));
```

Ensure your static middleware points to the correct output folder.

---

### ‚úÖ 7. **Check What Was Actually Deployed**

See the latest release and commit:
```bash
heroku releases -a your-app-name
heroku releases:info vNN -a your-app-name   # Replace vNN with the latest version
```

Confirm your local commit matches what was deployed:
```bash
git log -n 1
```

---

### ‚úÖ 8. **Tail the Logs**

Monitor what Heroku is actually serving when you access the site:
```bash
heroku logs --tail -a your-app-name
```

Look for signs it's serving the old route or static content.

---

### ‚úÖ 9. **Static Assets Not Updating**

If using a frontend build (e.g., Create React App), the static files might not have been updated.

**Fix:**  
SSH into Heroku:

```bash
heroku run bash -a your-app-name
# Inside shell:
ls -la
cat dist/index.html   # Or build/index.html
```

Make sure the content reflects the latest changes.

---

### ‚úÖ 10. **Force Clear Heroku Build Cache**

Sometimes, Heroku caches old builds unless manually cleared.

**Fix:**
```
heroku builds:cache:purge -a APP_NAME --confirm APP_NAME
```

---

### ‚úÖ 11. **Manually Inspect Deployed Files**

You can SSH into your Heroku dyno to **inspect the actual deployed files**.

**Fix:**
```bash
heroku run bash -a your-app-name
```

Once inside, use commands like:

```bash
ls
cd dist  # or cd build
cat index.html
```

This helps confirm if your deployed files match the latest build.

---

## Recap

If Heroku says it deployed successfully but your site looks outdated:

- Clear browser and CDN cache
- Confirm the correct branch and app
- Rebuild static content
- Restart dynos
- Ensure Express is serving the correct folder
- Use logs and SSH to inspect the actual files and behavior
- Clear the Heroku build cache if needed
