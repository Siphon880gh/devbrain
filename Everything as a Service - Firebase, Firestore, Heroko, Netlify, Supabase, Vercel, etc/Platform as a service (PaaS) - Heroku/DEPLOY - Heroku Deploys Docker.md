Heroku supports container-based apps through Docker. Whether you're using a raw `Dockerfile` or the more integrated `heroku.yml` setup, here’s how to deploy your containerized app the right way.

---

## 🧼 Step 1: Clear Buildpacks (if switching from traditional build)

If your Heroku app previously used a buildpack (e.g., Node.js or Python), **clear it first** to avoid conflicts:

```bash
heroku buildpacks:clear -a your-app-name
```

This step is **only needed once**.

---

## 📦 Option 1: Use the Heroku Docker CLI (`Dockerfile` only)

This is the direct way to push and release a Docker image to Heroku.

### ✅ Commands:

```bash
heroku container:push web -a your-app-name
heroku container:release web -a your-app-name
```

- `push` builds the Docker image locally and sends it to Heroku
- `release` tells Heroku to use that image for your app

**Great for:** Custom Dockerfiles, full control over build process

---

## ⚙️ Option 2: Use `heroku.yml` + `git push`

If you prefer Git-based workflows and want Heroku to build the Docker image for you (on their servers), use a `heroku.yml`.

### Example `heroku.yml`:

```yaml
build:
  docker:
    web: Dockerfile
run:
  web: npm start
```

### ✅ Deploy with:

```bash
git push heroku main
```

- Heroku will detect `heroku.yml` and build your image during deployment
    
- Simpler than managing CLI pushes/releases
    

**Great for:** Teams, GitOps workflows, pipelines

## 🔍 Pro Tip: Check it worked

Run:

```bash
heroku logs --tail -a your-app-name
```

...to see live logs, verify your Docker image is running, and catch errors.

## 🧠 Summary

|Method|Use Case|Deploy Command|
|---|---|---|
|`container:push`|Direct Docker control, CI/CD|`heroku container:push/release`|
|`heroku.yml + git`|Simpler, Git-based flow|`git push heroku main`|
