# Troubleshooting - Missing node_modules and meaning to use npm install?
- Possible fix: Make sure you don't have modules that are supposed to be in dependencies being in devDependencies at package.json
- Is it complaining that it can't detect the language? Refer to that lesson.
- No need to get into the heroku SSH with `heroku run bash` because npm install was run everytime you push the repository up to heroku.
