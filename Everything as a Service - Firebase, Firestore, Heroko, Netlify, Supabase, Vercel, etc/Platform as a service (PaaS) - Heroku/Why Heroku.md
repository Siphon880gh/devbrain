**1. Improved Security by Default**  
Heroku protects your files by isolating everything outside of the `public/` or `static/` directories. This means sensitive server-side files cannot be accessed directly through a browser—even if a developer tries to request them via URL. This built-in separation helps prevent common vulnerabilities like Local File Inclusion (LFI).

**2. No Need for `.env` Files in Production**  
Instead of storing environment variables in a potentially insecure `.env` file, Heroku provides a secure dashboard where you can set and manage them. This reduces the risk of accidentally exposing sensitive configuration data in your version control system or through misconfigured servers.

**3. Flexible File Serving Through Routes**  
Your app isn't limited to serving files only from the main entry point. With a properly configured Express (or similar) server, you can create custom routes to serve specific files, providing both flexibility and control over file access.

**4. Easy Environment Management**  
In **Heroku**, you don’t need to manually define `NODE_ENV`—it’s automatically set to `"production"` by the platform. As a result, frameworks like Express, React, and others will behave accordingly, such as disabling detailed error messages and enabling performance optimizations. If your Express `server.js` changes configuration or routes based on whether `NODE_ENV` is `"production"`, it will work as expected on Heroku.

**5. Free to Deploy, Pay to Run**  
Heroku doesn’t charge you for deploying an app (uploading your code and spinning up an environment). Charges only begin based on how long your app is active and what resources (like RAM or dyno hours) it consumes. This makes it ideal for testing, prototyping, and scaling gradually.
