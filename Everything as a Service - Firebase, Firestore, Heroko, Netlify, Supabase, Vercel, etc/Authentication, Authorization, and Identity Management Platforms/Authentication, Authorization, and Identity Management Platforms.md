In modern application development, handling **user identity**, **authentication**, and **authorization** securely and efficiently is critical. Rather than building these complex systems from scratch, developers often turn to specialized **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** platforms. These services help manage sign-up flows, secure API access, enable single sign-on (SSO), enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA), and integrate with third-party providers like Google, Facebook, or enterprise directories.

This comparison outlines the most popular platforms‚Äîranging from enterprise solutions like **Okta** and **Microsoft Entra ID**, to developer-friendly services like **Auth0**, **Clerk**, and **SuperTokens**, all the way to fully open-source systems like **Keycloak** and **Ory**. Whether you're launching a startup, scaling an enterprise product, or self-hosting for compliance reasons, there‚Äôs a solution that fits your needs.
