Explained in context:

Netlify fits the broad definition of a **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)**.  
It abstracts away the underlying infrastructure and gives you an opinionated platform where you:

|What you get|How it maps to typical PaaS features|
|---|---|
|**Git-based deploys** (build & publish when you push)|Managed build pipeline and release orchestration|
|**Static hosting + global CDN**|Managed web servers, caching, SSL, scaling|
|**Serverless Functions / Edge Functions**|“Runtime” layer similar to the app servers you’d get on Heroku or Render, but built on FaaS|
|**Add-on services** (forms, auth, analytics, image optimization)|Backend services exposed via simple APIs, no infrastructure to provision|
|**One-click environment variables, branch previews, rollbacks**|Environment management & lifecycle tooling typical of PaaS|
The main nuance is that Netlify’s focus is the **Jamstack** workflow (pre-rendered front-ends plus APIs & functions), so you don’t get a full Linux box or long-running processes like you would on a general-purpose PaaS such as Heroku. But from the developer’s point of view—push code, the platform builds, deploys, scales, secures, and serves it—it behaves very much like a specialized PaaS.
