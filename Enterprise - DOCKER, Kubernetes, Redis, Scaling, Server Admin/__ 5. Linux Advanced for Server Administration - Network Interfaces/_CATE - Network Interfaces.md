This folder focuses on **networking fundamentals**, particularly how network interfaces work. It’s designed to prepare you for more advanced tasks like configuring virtual network devices and adding VMs. This foundational knowledge is especially valuable when setting up VPS environments within a dedicated server—a common and practical approach for better security and control. Here’s why:

- **Crash Recovery During Development**: If a public-facing server crashes due to buggy code (e.g. during early development before a stable release), isolating it in a VM means you won’t have to rely on IT support—especially during off-hours or when dealing with slow ticket queues. Some dedicated server providers don’t grant full reboot access, or only allow it temporarily through a web interface that's enabled at the IT team's discretion.
- **Security Containment**: If the public-facing server is ever compromised, the damage is limited to the VM acting as the VPS. You can simply reflash the VM, patch any vulnerabilities, and restore from a backup—minimizing downtime, risk, and cost.
