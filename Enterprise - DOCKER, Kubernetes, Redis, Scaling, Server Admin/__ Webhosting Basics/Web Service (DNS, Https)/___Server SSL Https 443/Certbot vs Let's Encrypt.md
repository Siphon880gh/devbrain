Let’s Encrypt is a Certificate Authority (CA) that issues free SSL/TLS certificates by following a protocol called ACME — Automatic Certificate Management Environment. ACME defines the rules and process for automated certificate issuance and domain verification.

Both Let’s Encrypt and ACME were developed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a renowned organization advocating for digital rights and internet privacy. One notable detail: Let’s Encrypt certificates are always issued with a 90-day validity period.

To obtain a certificate, you can use the Certbot CLI, which performs a **DNS-01 challenge** — you'll be asked to add a specific TXT record to your domain's DNS settings. This proves you control the domain.

Alternatively, platforms like CloudPanel provide a Let’s Encrypt integration that uses the **HTTP-01 challenge**. In this method, a temporary verification file is placed in your website’s document root. Let’s Encrypt then tries to access it via http://yourdomain.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/.... If the file is reachable, it confirms that you control the domain.
