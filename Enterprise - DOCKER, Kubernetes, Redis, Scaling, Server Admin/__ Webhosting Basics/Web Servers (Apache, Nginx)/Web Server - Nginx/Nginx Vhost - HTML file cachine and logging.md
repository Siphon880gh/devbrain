```
location ~* \.(html|htm)$ {  
    expires 1h;  # Cache HTML files for 1 hour  
    access_log on;  # Enable logging for HTML files  
}
```

### Location Block
```nginx
location ~* \.(html|htm)$ {
```
- **location ~* \.(html|htm)$**: This line defines a location block that matches requests for HTML or HTM files.
  - **location**: Specifies a location block in NGINX configuration.
  - **~***: Indicates a case-insensitive regular expression match.
  - **\.(html|htm)$**: The regular expression that matches any file ending with .html or .htm. The **\\.** ensures that the dot is treated literally, **(html|htm)** matches either "html" or "htm", and **$** denotes the end of the string.

### Cache Expiration
```nginx
    expires 1h;  # Cache HTML files for 1 hour
```
- **expires 1h;**: This directive sets the caching time for matched files.
  - **expires**: Configures the expiration time for the files.
  - **1h**: Specifies that the files should be cached for 1 hour. After this time, the browser will request a new version of the file from the server.

### Access Logging
```nginx
    access_log on;  # Enable logging for HTML files
```
- **access_log on;**: This directive enables access logging for the matched files.
  - **access_log**: Manages the access logs in NGINX.
  - **on**: Turns on access logging for these requests.

In Ubuntu 22.04, the default location for NGINX access logs is usually `/var/log/nginx/access.log`. However, this can be configured differently in your NGINX configuration files.

To verify or change the log file location, you can check the NGINX configuration file. Hereâ€™s how you can find out where the logs go:

1. **Default Log File Location**: By default, NGINX logs are stored in the following files:
   - Access logs: `/var/log/nginx/access.log`
   - Error logs: `/var/log/nginx/error.log`

2. **Check NGINX Configuration**: Open the main NGINX configuration file (usually located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`) or any other configuration files included within it (like those in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` or `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`).

   You can use a command-line text editor like `nano` or `vim` to open the file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
   ```

3. **Look for `access_log` Directive**: Search for the `access_log` directive to see the path defined for the access logs.
   ```nginx
   access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
   ```

4. **Custom Log File Locations**: If the logs are set to go to a custom location, it will be specified in the configuration files. For example:
   ```nginx
   access_log /custom/path/to/access.log;
   ```

If the `access_log` directive is not explicitly defined within your specific location block, NGINX will use the global `access_log` settings defined in the main configuration file.

### Example
Here is an example of what the relevant section in the NGINX configuration might look like:
```nginx
http {
    log_format main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                      '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                      '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log main;

    server {
        location ~* \.(html|htm)$ {
            expires 1h;
            access_log on;
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, the access logs will be written to `/var/log/nginx/access.log`.

To view the logs, you can use the `cat`, `less`, or `tail` commands:
```bash
cat /var/log/nginx/access.log
```
or to follow the log entries in real-time:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
```

This should help you locate where the logs are being stored on your Ubuntu 22.04 system.
