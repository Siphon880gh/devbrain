We will be building on an older challenge [[3.03 Run Docker Compose off a remote Hub image]]. Don't worry if you don't have the files anymore because the coding work is very minimal.

In an empty folder, create this folder structure:
docker-compose.yml
./logs1
./logs2

So like this:
![[Pasted image 20250304002058.png]]

Modify docker-compose.yml to:
```
version: "3.8"
services:
  express-app1:
    image: siphon880d/express-app:latest
    ports:
      - "3001:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./logs1:/app/logs
  express-app2:
    image: siphon880d/express-app:latest
    ports:
      - "3002:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./logs2:/app/logs
```

Change the username at the "image" value as appropriate. Recall that if you followed the challenges, you've pushed an image of an express server that timestamps visits to the web browser at "/" and shows the timestamps in the web browser at "/visited". The challenge was at [[3.03 Run Docker Compose off a remote Hub image]].

Explanation: We run multiple instances of express-app, having to name them as different containers aka services to Docker: express-app1, and express-app2. Each service is to port 3001 and port 3002 on the host computer. 

The container port needs to be the port number that app.js listens to, so they stay the same at port 3000 for both services, and this doesn't cause conflicts because each container is in their own virtualized environment. In a similar way, the symbolic folder inside the container must be the same folder path that app.js writes to, so those stay the same as well - however, the host folder actually being written to (because of mounting), should differ (which helps us **prove** a point very soon).

---

Run the docker-compose.yml:
```
docker compose up -d
```

Visit `:3001/` in the web browser to record a timestamp at service #1.
Visit `:3002/` in the web browser to record a timestamp at service #2.

Then visit `:3001/visited` and `:3002/visited` to confirm there are several seconds distance between the pages (or however long you took to visit "/" at the other port)

This **proves** that you've ran two separate servers that writes to files at two separate folders/.

**Cleanup**
When done, perform cleanup. They've been in detached/daemon/background mode.

**Sneak Peak**
The next challenge will take this further by introducing a third service that communicates with these two services to combine their timestamps into one page. That would prove internal communication between containers.
