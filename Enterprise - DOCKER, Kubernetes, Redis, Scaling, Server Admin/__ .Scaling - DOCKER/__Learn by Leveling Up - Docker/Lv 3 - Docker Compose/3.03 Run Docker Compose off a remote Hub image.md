Goal: We'll push the express app that logs timestamps onto the Hub as an image anyone can download. Then we'll use the docker-compose.yml to DOWNLOAD BUILT IMAGE and then RUN.

Firstly, let's push to the Hub. You should have a docker account and know how from [[2.02 Push Architecture Specific Image to Hub]]. 

But briefly, check for the express-app (the one where user visits web-browser at "/" to timestamp and "/visited" to see the timestamps):
```
docker images
```

If the image is missing and/or you need to re-build the image again, go ahead and do so at the folder with the Docker file.

Then tag and push the image to your Hub, making sure you've been authenticated with `docker login -u USER` first:

You tag the already existing image then map it to your username and desired remote repo name like this:.
```
docker tag express-app USERNAME/express-app
```
^ Make sure to replace with your username
^ It succeeds if there's no messages or errors

Once tagged, then you may push to the Docker Hub:
```
docker push USERNAME/express-app
```

You can see all your pushed repos by visiting your Docker profile:
https://hub.docker.com/u/USERNAME

---


Now we will test that Docker Compose can run a container without the image OR the original files existing locally. We want Docker Compose to download the built image, then run container.

So secondly, make sure all images and containers referring to the express app are removed and killed off. This ensures docker-compose.yml doesn't get to run from any local images or that we inadvertently mistaken a running container as a successful docker compose command.

Kill any express-app containers. You may have one running from the previous challenge(s) if they haven't been killed:

1. List actively running containers
```
docker ps
```

2. Kill command:
```
docker kill CONTAINER_ID
```

Then remove all express-app images:

1. List images that Docker has built:
```
docker images
```

2. Remove image (rmi):
```
docker rmi IMAGE_OR_CONAINER_NAME
```

---

**Thirdly**, we now test if Docker Compose can download the built image from Hub, and then run a virtual container off of it - all in one command.

Create a new folder or enter a blank folder so that we know there aren't original files or a Dockerfile to build from. Then create a docker-composed.yml and a folder called logs:
![[Pasted image 20250303194315.png]]

You will be editing the docker-compose.yml so that you provide an image value that follows the Hub name format. What was `image: express-app:latest` becomes `image: USERNAME/express-app:latest` corresponding to the tag and push in a previous step

Edit docker-compose.yml:
```
version: "3.8"
services:
  express-app:
    image: siphon880d/express-app:latest
    ports:
      - "3003:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./logs:/app/logs
```

^ Note the ':latest' tag is the default tag. You can see what the tag is by visiting (note adjust your username and repo name in the url first):
https://hub.docker.com/r/USERNAME/express-app/tags


Run docker compose up on the docker-compose.yml file:
```
docker compose up -d
```

Visit in web browser: `http://localhost:3003/` to log a visit timestamp

Visit in web browser: `http://localhost:3003/visited` or open `./logs/visited.log` to see the timestamps.

**Cleanup**
If all works well, please kill the container or shut down the compose, and you may proceed with the next step.

- Kill the container (not the preferred way with Docker Compose): `docker ps`... `docker kill CONTAINER_ID --force`
- Or shut down the compose (preferred way): `docker compose down`
