KVM is just one of several virtualization technologies that utilize hardware virtualization extensions. 

Yes, it is possible for a system to support hardware virtualization without supporting KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). 

But KVM is the fastest of the hardware virtualizations 

Here are a few scenarios where hardware virtualization is supported but KVM is not used:

- Other Hypervisors:
	- Xen: Xen is a popular hypervisor that uses hardware virtualization extensions (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) but does not use KVM. Xen operates at a lower level than KVM and can run both paravirtualized and fully virtualized guests.
	- VMware ESXi: VMware's hypervisor also uses hardware virtualization extensions without relying on KVM.
	- Microsoft Hyper-V: This is another hypervisor that uses hardware virtualization features but is distinct from KVM.
- Bare-Metal Hypervisors:
	- Hypervisors like VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V are examples of bare-metal hypervisors that directly interface with hardware without needing a host operating system like Linux (which KVM requires).
- Alternative Virtualization Solutions:
	- VirtualBox: While primarily a hosted hypervisor, VirtualBox can use hardware virtualization extensions (VT-x/AMD-V) but does not depend on KVM.
	- Parallels: Parallels Desktop for Mac uses hardware virtualization extensions but does not utilize KVM.

### Key Points about Hardware Virtualization and KVM:

1. **Hardware Virtualization Support**:
    
    - Hardware virtualization extensions like Intel VT-x and AMD-V enable the creation of virtual machines (VMs) by allowing multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a host system with minimal performance overhead.
    - These extensions are supported by the CPU and must be enabled in the system BIOS or UEFI settings.
2. **Different Virtualization Technologies**:
    
    - Besides KVM, other virtualization technologies that utilize hardware virtualization include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen, and Oracle VirtualBox.
    - Each of these technologies can take advantage of hardware virtualization extensions to improve performance and efficiency.
3. **System Support**:
    
    - A system can support hardware virtualization extensions without supporting KVM specifically. For instance, a system running Windows might utilize Hyper-V, while a system running a different hypervisor like VMware ESXi does not necessarily rely on KVM.
4. **Performance**:
    
    - KVM is often praised for its performance and integration with the Linux kernel, making it a fast and efficient choice for virtualization on Linux systems.
    - The performance of KVM is comparable to other high-performance hypervisors when properly configured, but the actual performance can depend on various factors including hardware configuration, workload type, and specific use case.
5. **Advantages of KVM**:
    
    - **Integration with Linux**: As a part of the Linux kernel, KVM benefits from the ongoing development and optimizations of the Linux ecosystem.
    - **Wide Adoption**: Many cloud providers and enterprise environments use KVM due to its performance and stability.
    - **Flexibility**: KVM supports a wide range of guest operating systems, making it versatile for different deployment scenarios.
6. **Comparison to Other Technologies**:
    
    - **VMware ESXi**: Known for its robust feature set and enterprise-grade management tools, often used in large data centers.
    - **Microsoft Hyper-V**: Integrated with Windows Server, it offers strong support for Windows environments and tight integration with other Microsoft products.
    - **Xen**: Known for its use in large-scale cloud environments like Amazon Web Services (AWS).
    - **Oracle VirtualBox**: Popular for desktop virtualization with a user-friendly interface.
