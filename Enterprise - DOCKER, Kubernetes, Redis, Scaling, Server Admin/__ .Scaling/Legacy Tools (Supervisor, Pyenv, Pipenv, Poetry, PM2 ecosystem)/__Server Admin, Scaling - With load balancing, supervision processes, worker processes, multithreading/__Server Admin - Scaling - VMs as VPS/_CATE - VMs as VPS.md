By default, a partition is simply a section of your storage used to hold files. However, you can **virtualize a partition** by installing a separate Linux OS on it, effectively turning it into its own virtual machine (VM).

Why do this? Running VMs on separate partitions allows you to create additional **virtual servers** that can scale independently in terms of resources like CPU and RAM. This setup offers flexibility, isolation, and operational advantages.
