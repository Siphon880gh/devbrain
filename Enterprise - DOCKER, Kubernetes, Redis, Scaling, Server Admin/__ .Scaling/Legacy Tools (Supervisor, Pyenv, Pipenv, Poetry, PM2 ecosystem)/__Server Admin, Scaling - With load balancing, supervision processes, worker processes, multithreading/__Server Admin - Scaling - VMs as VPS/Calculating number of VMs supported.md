\< I have a dedicated server and I intend to split the dedicated server into VPS servers in the way of virtualizing into VMs. How to calculate how many VMs is supported with our current cpu cores and threads?

\> Calculating the number of virtual machines (VMs) supported by your current CPU cores and threads involves several considerations, including the specific workload requirements, the hypervisor overhead, and the allocation of CPU resources to each VM. Here are the steps you can follow to estimate the number of VMs:

1. **Determine Available CPU Resources:**
   - Identify the total number of physical CPU cores and threads in your system.
   - Note the CPU architecture (e.g., Intel Hyper-Threading provides two threads per core).

2. **Understand VM Requirements:**
   - Identify the typical CPU requirements for the VMs you plan to deploy (e.g., number of vCPUs per VM).
   - Consider the type of workload each VM will run (e.g., web server, database, etc.).

3. **Hypervisor Overhead:**
   - Account for the overhead introduced by the hypervisor (e.g., VMware, Hyper-V, KVM). This typically ranges from 5% to 10% of the total CPU resources.

4. **Calculate CPU Allocation:**
   - **Without Hyper-Threading:**
     - Total available vCPUs = Number of physical cores * Number of threads per core
   - **With Hyper-Threading:**
     - Total available vCPUs = Number of physical cores * 2 (assuming two threads per core)

5. **Consider Overcommitment:**
   - Overcommitment allows you to allocate more vCPUs than physical CPUs, relying on the fact that not all VMs will use 100% of their allocated vCPUs at the same time. A common overcommitment ratio is 4:1 (four vCPUs for every physical CPU core).

6. **Calculate Supported VMs:**
   - **No Overcommitment:**
     \[
     \text{Number of VMs} = \frac{\text{Total vCPUs}}{\text{vCPUs per VM}}
     \]
   - **With Overcommitment:**
     \[
     \text{Number of VMs} = \frac{\text{Total vCPUs} \times \text{Overcommitment Ratio}}{\text{vCPUs per VM}}
     \]

### Example Calculation

Assume you have a server with 16 physical CPU cores and each core supports 2 threads (Hyper-Threading enabled).

1. **Total vCPUs:**
   \[
   \text{Total vCPUs} = 16 \text{ cores} \times 2 \text{ threads per core} = 32 \text{ vCPUs}
   \]

2. **Hypervisor Overhead (10%):**
   \[
   \text{Available vCPUs} = 32 \text{ vCPUs} \times 0.90 = 28.8 \approx 28 \text{ vCPUs}
   \]

3. **VM Requirements:**
   Assume each VM requires 2 vCPUs.

4. **No Overcommitment:**
   \[
   \text{Number of VMs} = \frac{28 \text{ vCPUs}}{2 \text{ vCPUs per VM}} = 14 \text{ VMs}
   \]

5. **With Overcommitment (4:1):**
   \[
   \text{Number of VMs} = \frac{28 \text{ vCPUs} \times 4}{2 \text{ vCPUs per VM}} = 56 \text{ VMs}
   \]

### Notes

- Adjust the overcommitment ratio based on your workload's nature and performance requirements.
- Monitor the actual CPU usage to ensure performance remains acceptable and adjust the overcommitment ratio accordingly.
- For more accurate calculations, consider memory and storage requirements, as they can also impact the number of supported VMs.
