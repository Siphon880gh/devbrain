Cockpit, Proxmox, and TrueNAS provide graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to manage hypervisors, virtual machines (VMs), and other system functionalities, but they have different primary focuses and capabilities:

1. **Cockpit**:
   - **Purpose**: A web-based server management tool.
   - **Focus**: Simplifies system administration tasks for Linux servers.
   - **Capabilities**: Allows managing storage, network configurations, system monitoring, and basic virtual machine management through a user-friendly interface. It integrates with existing tools on your Linux server.

2. **Proxmox**:
   - **Purpose**: An open-source server virtualization management solution.
   - **Friend's Warnings:** It's built more for Debian. You may have difficulties on Ubuntu
   - **Focus**: Provides comprehensive management for KVM-based virtual machines and Linux containers (LXC).
   - **Capabilities**: Offers advanced features for clustering, backup, live migration, and high availability. Itâ€™s primarily used to create and manage VMs and containers with a robust web interface.

3. **TrueNAS**:
   - **Purpose**: A network-attached storage (NAS) solution that also supports virtualization.
   - **Focus**: Primarily designed for storage management but includes VM capabilities.
   - **Capabilities**: Manages storage pools, datasets, and shares with support for ZFS. It also provides the ability to create and manage VMs and jails (FreeBSD-based containers), making it versatile for both storage and virtualization needs.

### Comparison:

- **Cockpit**: Best for system administrators looking for an easy-to-use interface for managing Linux servers with some VM capabilities.
- **Proxmox**: Ideal for comprehensive virtualization management with advanced features for enterprise environments.
- **TrueNAS**: Excellent for storage-centric environments needing additional VM support.

Each tool has its strengths, so the best choice depends on your specific requirements for system management, storage, and virtualization.
