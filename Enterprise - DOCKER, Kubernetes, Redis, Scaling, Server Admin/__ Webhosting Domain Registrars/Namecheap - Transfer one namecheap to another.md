You can transfer a domain from one Namecheap account to another even if the domain was registered for 2 years. The registration term does not prevent internal transfersâ€”what matters is that the domain is:

1. **At least 60 days old** or has not been transferred within the last 60 days (per ICANN rules).
    
2. **Not under a registrar lock or ineligible status**, but internal pushes often bypass the traditional EPP/Auth code requirement.
    

### âœ… Steps to Transfer Domain Ownership (Push) Within Namecheap:

**For the current owner (the sender):**

1. Log in to your Namecheap account.
    
2. Go to **Domain List** â†’ Click **Manage** next to the domain.
    
3. Select the **Sharing & Transfer** tab.
    
4. Click **Change Ownership**.
    
5. Enter the recipient's **Namecheap username** or their **email address associated with a Namecheap account**.
    
6. Confirm and send the domain.
    

**For the new owner (recipient):**

- Theyâ€™ll receive a notification via email or inside their Namecheap dashboard.
    
- Once accepted, the domain moves into their account instantly.
    
- The domainâ€™s **registration term and DNS settings stay intact**â€”no downtime.
    

### ðŸ”’ Important Notes:

- The domain must not be involved in any disputes or have WHOIS privacy that blocks the transfer (may need to disable).
    
- A domain push **does not reset the registration term**â€”it remains active and unchanged.
    
- WHOIS contact details may optionally be updated during the push.
