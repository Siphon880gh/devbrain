In the context of:

If your Namecheap account already shows **\$50 in your account balance** under **Billing**, then:

✅ **That credit *will* be automatically applied to autorenewals**, **no extra steps needed**, as long as:
* Autoreneal is **enabled** for the service (domain, hosting, etc.)
* Your balance is **sufficient** to cover the renewal at the time it's due

### How it works

1. Namecheap will **first use your account balance** for any auto-renewal.
2. If your balance is not enough, it will then try your **default saved payment method**.

### To double-check

1. Go to **Namecheap Dashboard → Billing → Funds** to confirm the balance.
2. Go to **Domain List → Manage → Renewal Settings** for your domain or service, and make sure **Auto-Renew is ON**.

No additional setup is needed if the balance is there and auto-renew is enabled.
