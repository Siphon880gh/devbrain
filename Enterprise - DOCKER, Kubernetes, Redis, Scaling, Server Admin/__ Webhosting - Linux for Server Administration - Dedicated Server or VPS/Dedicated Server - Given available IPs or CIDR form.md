The dedicated server's provider may give you a block of available IPs. The idea is that you can create VMs acting as VPS in your dedicated server and those would get individual IPs. Another use of available IPs are to to assign IPs to multiple websites to separate traffic for security or organization purposes. Another use is to assign different IPs to email severs, FTP servers, or game servers to make it easier to manage and troubleshoot issues related to each service.

The provider might give you the range of IP addresses, or a block of IP addresses, or the CIDR form, like XXX.XX.XXX.XX/29

### Given CIDR Form

To find the public IP addresses in a given CIDR block, you can follow these steps. In this case, the CIDR block is `XXX.XX.XXX.XX/29`.

1. **Identify the range of IP addresses**: A `/29` subnet mask means there are 2^(32-29) = 8 IP addresses in the block.

2. **Calculate the network address**: The network address is the first address in the block, and it can be calculated by performing a bitwise AND between the IP address and the subnet mask.

3. **Calculate the broadcast address**: The broadcast address is the last address in the block, and it can be calculated by setting all the host bits to 1.

Let's take a hypothetical example to illustrate this:

Suppose the given CIDR block is `192.168.1.0/29`.

1. **Identify the subnet mask**: A `/29` subnet mask in decimal form is `255.255.255.248`.

2. **Calculate the network address**:
   ```
   IP address:         192.168.1.0
   Subnet mask:        255.255.255.248
   Network address:    192.168.1.0  (192.168.1.0 AND 255.255.255.248)
   ```

3. **Calculate the broadcast address**:
   ```
   Network address:    192.168.1.0
   Broadcast address:  192.168.1.7  (192.168.1.0 OR 0.0.0.7)
   ```

4. **List the IP addresses**:
   - Network address: 192.168.1.0 (reserved)
   - Usable IP addresses: 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.6
   - Broadcast address: 192.168.1.7 (reserved)

Thus, the public IP addresses in the `192.168.1.0/29` block are `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.6`.

You can follow the same steps for your specific CIDR block `XXX.XX.XXX.XX/29`. If you provide the exact CIDR block, I can calculate the specific public IP addresses for you.
