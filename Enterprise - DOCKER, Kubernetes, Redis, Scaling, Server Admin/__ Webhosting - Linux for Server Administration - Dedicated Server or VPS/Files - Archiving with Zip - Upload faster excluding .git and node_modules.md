## Zip It

**Uploading many files can be slow**, especially with large folders or numerous small files. A faster approach is to first **zip the entire folder**, upload the single archive, and then **extract it using SSH** on the server. As for uploading, you have various options (Refer to )

However, this method can still be slow if your archive includes large or unnecessary directories like `.git`. To avoid this, simply **exclude `.git` and `node_modules` folders recursively** during compression to speed up the process and reduce archive size.

Here’s how you can do it:

```bash
zip -r myarchive.zip myfolder -x "*/.git/*" "*/node_modules/*" "*/package-lock.json"
```

### Breakdown:

- `-r`: Recursively zip all files and directories.
- `myarchive.zip`: The name of the output zip file.
- `myfolder`: The folder you want to zip.
- `-x "*/.git/*"`: Excludes any `.git` directories recursively within `myfolder`.

### Example:

Say your folder structure is:

```
myfolder/
├── file1.txt
├── subdir/
│   └── file2.txt
└── .git/
    └── config
```

The above command will **exclude `.git/` and everything under it**, but zip up the rest.

## Unzip It

To **unzip** a `.zip` file from the command line:

### Basic command:

```bash
unzip myarchive.zip
```

### Common options:

- `-d <directory>`: Extract to a specific directory:
    
    ```bash
    unzip myarchive.zip -d mydestination/
    ```
    
- `-l`: List contents without extracting:
    
    ```bash
    unzip -l myarchive.zip
    ```
    
- `-o`: Overwrite files without prompting:
    
    ```bash
    unzip -o myarchive.zip
    ```
    

### Notes:

- `unzip` is usually pre-installed on most Linux and macOS systems. If not:
    
    - On **Debian/Ubuntu**: `sudo apt install unzip`
        
    - On **Red Hat/CentOS**: `sudo yum install unzip`
        
    - On **macOS (with Homebrew)**: `brew install unzip`
        

Let me know if you're unzipping on Windows, using `7z`, or working with `.tar.gz` or `.rar` instead — I can tailor the command.
