UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) are two core protocols of the Internet Protocol (IP) suite, each serving different purposes and having distinct characteristics. Here is a comparison of the two:

### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

1. **Connection-oriented**:
   - TCP establishes a connection between the sender and receiver before data can be sent. This connection is maintained until all data is transmitted.
   
2. **Reliability**:
   - TCP ensures that all data packets reach their destination in the correct order. It handles packet loss by retransmitting lost packets and acknowledges received packets.
   
3. **Flow Control**:
   - TCP uses flow control mechanisms to prevent overwhelming the receiver with too much data at once.
   
4. **Error Checking**:
   - TCP includes error checking for data integrity. It ensures that any corrupted data is detected and retransmitted.

5. **Data Transmission**:
   - Data is transmitted as a stream of bytes. It is well-suited for applications where data integrity and order are crucial, such as web browsing, email, and file transfers.

6. **Overhead**:
   - TCP has higher overhead due to the need for establishing and maintaining a connection, error checking, and flow control.

### User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

1. **Connectionless**:
   - UDP does not establish a connection before sending data. Each data packet (datagram) is sent independently.
   
2. **Speed**:
   - UDP is faster than TCP because it has less overhead. It does not establish connections, acknowledge packets, or perform error checking at the protocol level.

3. **Unreliability**:
   - UDP does not guarantee that packets will reach their destination, nor does it ensure the order of packet arrival. Packets may be lost, duplicated, or arrive out of order.

4. **No Flow Control**:
   - UDP does not have flow control mechanisms, so it does not prevent sending too much data too quickly for the receiver to handle.

5. **Data Transmission**:
   - Data is transmitted as discrete messages (datagrams). UDP is suitable for applications where speed is more critical than reliability, such as video streaming, online gaming, and DNS queries.

6. **Overhead**:
   - UDP has lower overhead because it does not establish connections, handle retransmissions, or perform extensive error checking.

### Summary

| Feature               | TCP                              | UDP                          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Connection**        | Connection-oriented              | Connectionless               |
| **Reliability**       | Reliable, ensures data delivery  | Unreliable, no delivery guarantee |
| **Error Checking**    | Yes, with retransmissions        | Minimal, basic error checking |
| **Flow Control**      | Yes                              | No                           |
| **Speed**             | Slower due to overhead           | Faster, low overhead         |
| **Use Cases**         | Web browsing, email, file transfers | Video streaming, online gaming, DNS |
| **Data Transmission** | Stream of bytes                  | Independent datagrams        |

In essence, TCP is used where reliability and accuracy are crucial, while UDP is chosen for applications that prioritize speed and can tolerate some data loss or disorder.
