Wondering if you can safely upgrade your **Hostinger KVM VPS** (like **KVM 2**) later on? The short answer: **Yes—you can upgrade without data loss.**

### 🔼 Seamless Upgrade Process

According to Hostinger, upgrading is a simple and fast process:

- Takes about **10 minutes**
    
- **No data loss** – all your files, emails, databases, and configurations stay intact
    
- Managed through the **hPanel interface**:  
    Just click **Upgrade** next to your VPS, choose your desired tier, and follow payment steps.
    

### ⚠️ A Few Things to Note:

- **KVM 8** is the highest plan in the KVM series. If you outgrow that, you’ll need to spin up **additional VPS instances** and manage your workload across them manually.
    
- There’s **no need to reinstall your OS or panel**—everything transfers as-is.
    

> Perfect for growing projects: start with **KVM 2** + **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**, and scale as needed—without the headache.
