**Title:** `exec` in Bash: What It Does and When to Use It

**Introduction:**  
In Bash scripting, the `exec` command is often misunderstood. Unlike most commands, `exec` doesn't just run a program ‚Äî it **replaces** the current shell process with a new one. This can be powerful when used intentionally but problematic if used incorrectly.

> Do not confuse with exec() in PHP and NodeJS

### üîç What `exec` Does

When you run:

```bash
exec some_command
```

The shell process is **terminated** and replaced by `some_command`. No lines after `exec` will be executed.

### ‚úÖ When to Use `exec`

1. **Container/Process Startup (e.g., Docker)**
    
    - Replace the container‚Äôs PID 1 process to ensure proper signal handling.
        
    - Example:
        
        ```bash
        exec node server.js
        ```
        
2. **Process Hand-off**
    
    - When you want the script to hand over control to another process entirely (e.g., replacing the login shell).
        
    - Example:
        
        ```bash
        exec bash
        ```
        
3. **Avoiding Extra Processes**
    
    - `exec` prevents creating a child process, saving resources.
