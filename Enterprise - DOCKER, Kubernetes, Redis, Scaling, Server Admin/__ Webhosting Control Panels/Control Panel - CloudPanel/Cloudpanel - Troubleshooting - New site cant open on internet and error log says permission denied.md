Problem:
cloudpanel new site can't open on internet
when checked error log, it says permission denied

Solution:
- If previous sites no problem then this guide is for you. 
- If previous sites also problem then it's a setup problem with either cloudpanel or nginx, so refer to [[_ GET STARTED - Setup Dedicated Server Checklist]], in particular section on CPanel vhost 500 error because of file permission errors
