## SETUP/TEST SFTP

Newbie questions: Proftpd? vsFTPD? SFTP does not need them. 

By having SSH, you already have SFTP, and they run on the same port! And you can have multiple connections with the same SSH user. **Your SSH users are the same users for SFTP.**

You can use two types of SSH accounts - Root and non-root's.

1. Collect your SSH credentials
2. Setup in Filezilla according to the type of SSH user that will act as SFTP. Recommend createing both root and non-root in Filezilla. Non-root makes sure pages can be viewed and that web browser visited scripts can modify/create files as intended.

### Root SFTP Account
On Filezilla test logging into your root SSH account
- Protocol: SFTP. 
- Host: Public IP
- Port: Blank
Then supply the username and password
Once successfully logged in, recommend you set the remote directory default
### SFTP Non-root account
You want to login to non-root account so a webpage that’s not owned by root can modify another file or directory that you avoided creating as root owned when logged in as root on filezilla (PHP etc).
- Protocol: SFTP. 
- Host: Public IP
- Port: Blank
Then supply the site user username and site user password from CloudPanel. You do not need to add SSH Users under “SSH/FTP” tab. The site user is automatically a SSH user.
Once successfully logged in, recommend you set the remote directory default
