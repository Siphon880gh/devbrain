- **Support period:** 5 years of free security and maintenance updates
    
- **Example:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (supported through 2027)
    
- **Best for:** Reliability, fewer updates, and fewer surprises
    

### ‚ö° What is a Non-LTS Version?

Non-LTS versions (also called **interim releases**) come out every 6 months and are supported for only **9 months**.

- **Support period:** 9 months
