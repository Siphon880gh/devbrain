Maybe it's a colocation, maybe it's a dedicated server. It just depends on who owns the physical server and if you're paying for rack space or for a line item for a dedicated server

Differentiator: Since it sounds like you don't really have a colocation and are actually leasing a dedicated server, ask the customer support team to install proxmox or a basic Debian 12 server install... you are leasing a dedicated server, not owning a colocation.
