Uploading via **FileZilla over SFTP** is **reliable**, but **not the fastest** method—especially for large files or many small files. Here’s how FileZilla compares to other options and what might be **faster alternatives** when you have SSH access:

---

### Uploading

### 🔹 **1. FileZilla (SFTP)**

- **Pros**: User-friendly, drag-and-drop, supports resume.
- **Cons**: Slower due to GUI overhead and potentially limited parallelism.

### 🔹 **2. `scp` (Secure Copy) — Faster than FileZilla**

```bash
scp -i ~/.ssh/my_key.pem myarchive.zip user@host:/path/to/remote/
```

- **Pros**: Simple, runs from terminal, can be faster than GUI tools.
- **Progress**: 
	- Doesn't show progress unless `-v` or `pv` used.

### 🔹 **3. `rsync` over SSH — Fastest and most efficient**

```bash
rsync -avz -e "ssh -i ~/.ssh/my_key.pem" myarchive.zip user@host:/path/to/remote/
```

- **Pros**:
    - Compresses during transfer (`-z`)
    - Skips unchanged files on retries
    - Can resume interrupted transfers
- **Progress**: 
	- `-v`: verbose (shows file names as they are transferred, but no progress bar)
	- `--progress`: Show progress bar

 
 ✅ **Use `rsync` if you want the fastest, most resilient upload.**

## ⚖️ Comparison Table: File Upload Methods

|Method|Command Example|Speed|Progress Shown?|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**rsync**|`rsync -avz --progress -e "ssh -i ~/.ssh/key.pem" myproject.zip user@host:/remote/path/`|🚀 Fastest|✅ Yes|Efficient, resumable, compresses during transfer|
|**scp**|`scp -i ~/.ssh/key.pem -v myproject.zip user@host:/remote/path/`|⚡ Fast|✅ Yes (`-v`)|Simple, available on most systems|
|**FileZilla**|Use drag-and-drop with SFTP, login with your credentials or SSH key|🐢 Slowest|✅ GUI progress|Easy for beginners, less efficient with large files|
