## Scope

Settings screen is either organization specific or project specific

Settings apply to the organization (Here it’s WengIndustry) when at a subscreen for organization settings. Settings apply to the project (Default project or App 1 depending which one is selected) when at a subscreen for project settings:

They could've improved the interface a bit by putting emphasis on either the organization name or the project name depending on if the current subscreen.

Clicking a menu item under the Organization heading will open a subscreen whose settings affect the organization level. Clicking a menu item under the Project heading will open a subscreen whose settings affect at the project level:

## Features

At the OpenAI Platform’s settings screen, you can:
- View and adjust model usage limits
- Manage organization members, including who can:
- Access and view the dashboard
- Modify billing settings and view invoices
- Set or adjust credit limits and auto-repurchase options when usage reaches a set threshold
- Manage either the organization (all projects) or the project’s **API keys**, including the ability to:
    - **Block specific endpoints**
    - **Restrict access** to **read-only** or **write-only**
    - Having no restrictions means the endpoint can fully be read and/or written (if applicable)

Make sure roles and permissions are assigned carefully to control who can make changes to sensitive settings like billing and API access.

At OpenAI Platform’s setting screens, see model limits, manage members who can view the dashboard for this organization, and which members can affect billing, manage billing, and adjust billing limits and credits to repurchase when hit a number of credits use.
