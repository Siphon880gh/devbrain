Settings to get Project API Key OR show all project API Keys under the Organization

At Settings page, you can access either:
- All Project API Keys under the same organization, if you click "API Keys" menu item under "ORGANIZATION" section. The organization name at the top left is how it knows.
- The current project's API keys, if you click "API Keys" menu item under "PROJECT" section. The dropdown of the project names at the top left is how it knows.

It doesn’t matter if image model or text model, it's the same area where you create the API key. You can restrict the models for the API key afterwards. You might be asked to prove yourself with a camera - you can switch over to phone using QR Code. It would scan your ID card, then scan against your face to determine they match.
