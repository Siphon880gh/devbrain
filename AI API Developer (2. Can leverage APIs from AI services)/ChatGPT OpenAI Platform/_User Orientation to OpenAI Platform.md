The **OpenAI Platform** — found at [https://platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) — is **OpenAI's developer API portal**, distinct from the ChatGPT product. It's where you manage API keys, usage, billing, and access logs for your apps.

The interface can be confusing, so here’s a quick guide to orient yourself:

- Visiting `platform.openai.com` often redirects you to the [Docs Overview](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) - [https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview).  The default view is Docs.
- If you're trying to manage your account or apps instead of reading Docs, **use the top-right menu bar.**

**Top-right menu bar:**

**Dashboard:** 
- Is for a **specific project** under an organization. See Usage and manage Project API Keys. If you have have enabled Chat Completion logs, you can see logs of prompt and responses. 

**Settings:** 
- Is for either **specific organization or specific project**. It depends on which item you clicked at the left side bar and whether it belongs to the Organization navigation section or the Project navigation section
