🧠 Understanding Token Limits in GPT Models

_How context windows, output caps, and tools like `tiktoken` affect your prompts and replies_

### 📏 Model Token Limits

Each GPT model comes with hard limits that affect how much it can read, remember, and respond with. For example, the `gpt-4o-mini` model supports:

| Limit Type             | Value                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Context Window**     | 200,000 tokens (shared)     |
| **Max Output Tokens**  | 100,000 per single response |
| **Knowledge Cutoff**   | May 31, 2024                |
| **Advanced Reasoning** | ✅ Supported                 |

There are various places on ChatGPT or their backend docs (OpenAI Platform) where you can view this information. For example:

### 🔁 What’s a Context Window?

The **context window** is the total number of tokens the model can consider at once. This includes:

- Your current prompt
    
- All prior messages in the conversation
    
- The model’s own upcoming reply
    

Once the combined total exceeds 200,000 tokens, the model will **start forgetting older messages** — beginning with the earliest ones in the thread.

> [!note] Example  
> If your prompt is 150,000 tokens long, the model only has 50,000 tokens left for its reply. Any excess will be truncated.

### 🧠 Max Output vs. Thread History

The **100,000 max output token** limit refers to how long **a single reply** can be. It does **not** refer to the total number of tokens in your entire conversation thread. You could technically receive multiple 100k-token replies in a long thread — as long as each interaction stays within the 200k context cap.

---

### ⚠️ Why This Matters

- If your input is long (e.g., a huge article), the model may:
    

- **Forget early parts of your message**
    
- **Truncate its own response**
    

- This can make summaries incomplete or cause models to drop important details.
    

That’s why it’s crucial to **monitor token usage**, especially for long-form or multi-turn interactions.

### 🧰 Use `tiktoken` to Estimate Tokens

`tiktoken` is OpenAI’s official tokenizer. It’s based on **byte pair encoding (BPE)**, commonly used for both RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) and counting tokens accurately.

Here’s how you can use it in Python:

import tiktoken  
  
def count_tokens(text: str, model: str = "gpt-4o"):  
    encoding = tiktoken.encoding_for_model(model)  
    return len(encoding.encode(text))  
  
# Example usage  
print(count_tokens("This is a test."))  # Returns token count

This lets you:

- Pre-check your prompt length before submitting
    
- Split up large documents safely
    
- Estimate cost or avoid truncation

### ✅ Summary

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Concept|Key Point|
|**Context Window**|Shared by input + output (max 200k)|
|**Max Output Tokens**|One reply can be up to 100k tokens|
|**Overflow Handling**|Older messages are dropped|
|**tiktoken**|Use to measure input size|
