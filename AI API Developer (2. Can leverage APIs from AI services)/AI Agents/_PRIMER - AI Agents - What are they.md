Generally speaking, **AI agents in many AI apps are specialized workers that automate parts of your development workflow**. They operate semi-autonomously in the background, respond to triggers or events, transform files or data, and execute tasks based on structured instructions rather than open-ended conversation.

Unlike chat-based assistants, agents are typically designed to:
- **Handle narrow, well-defined responsibilities** (e.g., refactoring code, generating assets, validating outputs)
- **React to specific triggers** (file changes, webhooks, scheduled runs, user actions)
- **Work with other AI agents** (Double check another agent's work, etc)
- **Follow deterministic, step-by-step instructions**
- **Produce artifacts** such as files, diffs, reports, or structured outputs

In practice, they function more like programmable workers in a pipeline—closer to CI jobs, background services, or task runners—than general-purpose AI copilots.
