In some agentic technologies, there are agents that play roles, like a summary agent or a QA agent. There might also be an identity (you can name an AI Agent) so you can instruct Agent 2 to wait for Agent 1 to finish before performing X.

For example, you could have "Agents" on an AI-powered knowledge management platform for your employees:
- **Personality Agent** — Automatically rewrites your bot’s replies to match any tone or persona you define.  
- **Summary Agent** — Condenses conversations and stores the summary in a variable for later use.  
- **Translator Agent** — Translates text into the user’s preferred language on the fly.  
- **Knowledge Agent** — Lets your bot answer questions using your connected knowledge bases.

Those AI Agents could have been personalized, much like [Marblism](https://marbliism.com/)where each Agent has a name (eg. Inda, Sonny, Eva, etc). Our hypothetical AI-powered knowledge management platform could also make it fun by having these AI agents given names (next to their AI employee title) and a face to it (albeit AI generated face). You'd have an AI "colleague" helping you summarizing information on the platform.
